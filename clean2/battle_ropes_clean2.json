Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",

Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",

The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 40 feet with a 1.5-in diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a full-body workout focusing on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your workout by shortening the ropes; increase the power by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: We provide a complete selection of ropes ranging from intermediate users to advanced. We highly recommend the 30 FT ropes with either 1.5 or 2-inch diameters if you are starting to build out your home gym.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The three-strand-thick exercise rope features comfortable hand grips and a durable Poly Dacron blend made to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out and offers reliable, long-lasting performance so that you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: This Battle Rope measures 30 FT long by 2-inches wide. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying, which will significantly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."
