            "Cost & Space Saving Choice: The GMWD vertical leg press machine is an excellent space saving machine. It's great for those who want to do leg press but don't have much space at home. Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad. Laying flat on the back pad, horizontally to the ground, your lower back, upper back, and neck, are almost completely left out of it. This can minimize lower back rounding and maintain your spine's natural curve. 5\u00b0Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising.",
            "Liner Bearing Design: Unlike other brands\u2019 nylon bushings or roller bearings, we updated liner bearings. \"Linear bearing\" means a higher cost for GMWD but a better feeling for you. You won't feel any clogged while you're exercising. Start your leg training more coherently and smoothly.",

            "Isolation of Lateral Deltoids: The machine provides targeted isolation of the lateral deltoid muscles, which can be beneficial if you're looking to specifically develop this area of your shoulders. Machines generally provide a more controlled movement compared to free weights, reducing the risk of using improper form or cheating during the exercise.",
            "Commercial in Home Gym: The main body is made of 14-gauge steel. Dimensions 42.5\u2019\u2019(L) x 45\u2019\u2019(W) x 60\u2019\u2019(H). Gross weight: 105lb. We have two extra storage pins that you can use to store the rest of the Olympic weights. Don't let your home be a mess again.",
            "Ball Bearing Design: Our lateral raise machine is equipped with high-quality ball bearings inside the grip to provide frictionless rotation of the handle, ensuring a smooth and seamless moving experience.

This beast of a machine is designed to target your pectoral muscles with precision, giving you that chiseled and well-defined chest you've always desired. With adjustable resistance and a comfortable seat, you can push your limits while maintaining proper form",
            "CHEST MACHINE HOME GYM - The seated chest press machine eliminates the need for stabilizing muscles, which are necessary for maintaining balance during a bench press. This results in a focus solely on the chest muscles rather than engaging those that assist in pressing movements, which may not align with functional fitness goals. Place up to 220lbs on each weight horn with standard 2-inch olympic plates",
            "PERFECT FOR HOME OR COMMERCIAL GYM - Compact machine for home gyms, commercial gyms or smaller workout spaces",
            "BENEFITS - This machine targets the pectorals, the main muscles of the chest. The same muscles you use when pushing a grocery cart or to get up off the floor. The chest press machine also recruits the biceps and the big muscles of the shoulders and back. That makes this exercise especially beneficial for those who participate in sports that involve the swinging of a bat, racket or golf club",

The rotary flywheel mechanism allows for complete control over your starting position. Replaced the installation of the limiters, a simple plug can be completed between the back extension and AB crunch mode conversion. Designed to save space and money by combining two commonly separate machines, into one compact, multi-function machine.",

You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",
            "Adequate Back Support: The 2 inch padded cushion is made with a high quality leatherette surface that is easy to clean while guaranteeing comfort during your workout. The seat height also has five adjustable options, with an adjustable height range of 20.8''-24.7'', so don't worry about height being a limitation to your use of this upper body training equipment.",
            "Full Range Adjustable: Rotary flywheel mechanism and pop pin design allow for easy adjustment. 27 selectable holes that enable you to achieve over 180 degrees of adjustment. It allows for complete control over your starting position.",
            "Sculpt Core Muscles: The core acts as the center of your body and helps you utilize every other part of your body to maximum efficiency. Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."

            "\u3010Stability & Versatile Workout\u3011This two-in-one leg press and hack squat machine, red model, adopts linear bearings rather than rolling ones, and it is constructed of heavy-duty high tensile beefy steel. Beyond that, there are two weight plate storage holders at the rear bottom, when stacked up, greatly enhance machine's stability when in motion. By adjusting the placement of your feet on the foot plate, you can focus more on training isolating muscle groups.",
            "\u3010Multiple Adjustments\u3011As a well-crafted design, there are 5 angle choices for hack squat and 3 for leg press setting, accomodating different sized athelets. The side rail (safety catches attached) handles can be pushed out to unlock the sled. After you are done with your set, pull both handles inward yourself to lock the sled in your designated lockout position. With a quick flip of the back pad and lowering of the leg press footplate, you can switch workouts in seconds to perform hack squat.",
            "\u3010Comfort & Smooth Exercise Experience\u3011This leg press and hack squat gym machine features thick shoulder and backrest cushion wrapped in premium anti-slip and wear-resistant leather surface, providing ultimate and long-lasting comfort to ease your strain and stress, and protecting your bones and joints during your bodybuilding. Solid metal guide rods (sled) and aluminium alloy grips on both sides upgrade your workout experience without jerk motions.",
            "\u3010Safety & Considerate Design\u3011The weight carriage fits 2'' plates, and Max 1200 lbs plate loading satisfies most users' needs. It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use. Two cushionings at the sled's bottom soften sudden impact with less noise. The triangular piece at the base of the back support also enhances overall stability.",
            "\u3010Separate Package\u3011Our leg press and hack squat machine will be shipped in two separate packages to minimize the possibility of wear and tear due to collisions. Your packages may arrive on different dates. If you only receive part of the shipment, please be patient as we continuously monitor your logistics status.
