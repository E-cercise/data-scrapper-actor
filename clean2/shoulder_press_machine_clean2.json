Machines generally provide a more controlled movement compared to free weights, reducing the risk of using improper form or cheating during the exercise.",
            "Ball Bearing Design: Our lateral raise machine is equipped with high-quality ball bearings inside the grip to provide frictionless rotation of the handle, ensuring a smooth and seamless moving experience. The smooth process facilitated by the ball bearings ensures a consistent and controlled motion, reducing strain on the wrists, forearms, and shoulders. The use of ball bearings in the grip handles also improves the durability and longevity of the machine."
