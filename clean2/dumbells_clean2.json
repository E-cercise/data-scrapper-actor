Our fitness weights feature a solid textured grip. The handle design features a curved center that contours to the natural arch of your hand giving the user a secure but not overly aggressive feel for a truly exceptional workout experience. The solid steel polypropylene coated bars are 17 inches long to provide ample space to accommodate the 6 interchangeable vinyl plates. The mid-point of the Handlebar measures 1.1 inches in diameter. This set includes (4) 1.5 lb weights, (4) 2.5 lb weights, and (4) 5 lb weights totaling 40 pounds when fully assembled. Polypropylene locking collar stars (0.2 lb each) tighten to hold the plates in place even during intense movements. Add or remove the smooth incremental plates to target muscles in your arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, and core while preventing damage to floors and surfaces compared to cast iron counterparts. Eliminate the need for a large rack in your in-home workout area as you easily assemble different weight amounts to use during full body toning workouts.",
