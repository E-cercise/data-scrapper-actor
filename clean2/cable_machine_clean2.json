It comes with a tricep rope, a pull down rope and a straight bar, which can be used for different LAT cable attachments. It can also be used as a pull-up bar and a punching bag hanger.",
            "\u3010Super Stable and Durable\u3011The 12 hole design of our wall mounted pull up bar is more stable and safer than other products. It can support up to 400 lbs of weight and is made of high-quality iron material. It is easy to install and comes with all the mounting hardware you need.",
