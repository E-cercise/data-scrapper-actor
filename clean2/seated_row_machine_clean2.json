Rubber end caps on each foot of the Row Machine provide additional stability to the frame and prevent damage to your home gym floor.",
            "INDEPENDENT ARMS: Each arm on this seated row back pull machine works independently of each other. This gives you the option to work both sides of your back at the same time or in an alternating manner. Either way, this allows you to focus on each side of your back (without one side doing the bulk of the work), so you can strengthen each side of your back muscles including the lat muscles and spinal erectors, as well as your biceps as a secondary target",
            "VERSATILE GRIPS: This workout machine includes a stationary grip handle that allows you to target your back muscles like a T Row T Bar Row Machine, as well as a rotating grip handle. The rotating grip handle allows you to pivot your arm naturally during the row for a more comfortable movement/workout with less strain on your elbows",
            "ADJUSTABLE: The seat pad adjusts in 4 positions vertically to find the right height for you during your workout, while the chest pad adjusts in 5 different positions. The seat is tapered for a comfortable and natural position during your row workout.",
            "PLATE LOADED- It can hold both standard and Olympic sized weights or bumper weight plates. Purchase includes 2 Olympic sleeve adapters, and both Olympic and standard sized spring clips",
            "ADDITIONAL: The seated row and pull machine is perfect for athletes of all levels, in any home gym or light-commercial fitness center. Max weight load of 200 lb per arm - 400 lb total max weight load"

This means it only generates 30 dB of sound when in operation, so the machine won't disturb your neighbors, even if you exercise late at night",
