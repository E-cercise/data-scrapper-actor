Maybe it's the 460+ home exercise options, or even the eye-catching design that\u2019s cleaner than other workout posters. Regardless, just be careful when you stick Grand Basics on your wall, because you might just get in shape faster than you thought!",
            "460+ Exercise Ideas - While we don\u2019t show you how to create a workout, we give you enough exercises in your workout poster set to last forever! In fact, if you choose 5 random exercises every day, you\u2019d have workouts to last for 50 Billion Years (we did the math). Easy to understand for Beginners, but also easy to glance for pros and PT\u2019s to plan out a personal training session or create it on the fly.",

            "Smooth, Eye-Catching Surface - We use 200gsm, 1.5MIL Laminated Paper for your home gym posters. And unlike thick laminated fitness posters, ours are easier to roll up, and easier to flatten so they sit nice and flat on your wall (use 3M adhesive strips). But more importantly, The Color-Block Titles and Color-Coded Design looks clean and tidy in your home gym decor so it\u2019s easier to find what you need.",
            "As Seen in Yoga Journal - If you\u2019re looking for one of the top poster sets according to the number one source for in-depth yoga pose instruction, (and our existing customers), why not try this set now for 30-Days. They\u2019ll arrive pre-rolled, with instructions on how to easily flatten them. And, if you\u2019re not happy you can return for a refund. So, let\u2019s go!
