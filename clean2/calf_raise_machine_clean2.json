It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use.

        "features": [
            "[Independent Dual Pulley System] Unlike the common power cage, the HR05 has an independent 1:1 ratio double pulley system on both sides of the frame. 1:1 means that the weight you train is the weight you load. And the weight capacity of power rack will double. The independent pulley system allows you to complete super set, drop set, co-training and other gym workouts without being limited by the home gym weight stack cap.",
            "[4-IN-1 Home Gym Partner] HR05 combines a power rack, multi-grip pull up bar, cable crossover machine and 360\u00b0 landmine into one machine. At the same time, the pulley system has been upgraded to give you a seamless and stable movement experience. The improved sliding sleeve ensures smooth operation while protecting the pulley from damage. Gross Weight: 205 lbs. The machine boasts a maximum capacity of up to 2000 lbs.",
            "[Unique Column] More holes have been drilled into the HR05 power cage's posts at 1-inch spacing, giving you a total of 30 height options. There are also digital markers on the side to help you locate quickly. In addition, we use the standard 2\"x 2\" column, which can be adapted to a variety of accessories on the market to unlock more training possibilities. The tube thickness of 2 mm effectively ensures the stability of the power rack.",
            "[Space-saving Design] Another major feature of the HR05 is the space savings, the frame design is closer to half rack, compared to most power racks, its space can be reduced by nearly two-thirds. In addition, we are equipped with more weight storage areas in the middle of HR05, which can not only effectively organize the space of the home gym, but also increase the stability of the shelves.",
            "[Fully equipped & versatile] The HR05 power cage comes with all the attachments you may need more of in your daily training. including 4 free handle attachments, 2 safety spotter pins, dip bars, j hooks, and T-bar row attachment. This provides a wide range of exercises, such as wide & narrow lat pull-downs, T-bar rows, seated cable rows, bench presses, squats, deadlifts, bicep curls, triceps extensions, pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, and more."

        "description": "The Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine (GSCL360) handles the heaviest loads with ease to help you develop explosive lower-body power. The squat is the ultimate exercise for building mass and strength in your thighs, glutes, calves, and lower back. This squat machine is designed to handle massive weight loads of over 800 pounds (Olympic weight plates sold separately), and it is specifically engineered to help to eliminate the risks of this essential exercise while enhancing its benefits and increasing its effectiveness. The heavy-gauge diamond plate foot platform is set to a perfect 20-degree pitch, delivering optimal development of the quadriceps and glutes. The innovative calf raise block is round instead of square, eliminating the painful edge and providing a deep pre-stretch for maximum calf-blasting workouts. Exclusive DuraFirm shoulder pads are engineered to conform to the shoulders and back for a safe and secure fit during the heaviest lifts. This squat machine is constructed with an extra-large 3- by 3-inch high-tensile-strength mainframe made with 12-gauge steel welded on all four sides, allowing it to stand up to massive workloads in high-traffic gyms and clubs. When assembled, the Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine measures 62 by 43 by 56 inches (L x W x H) and weighs 170 pounds. It is backed by the Body-Solid Lifetime In-Home and Full Commercial .",

It is also more suitable for people with knee injuries while ensuring normal hip rotation within a natural range of motion.",

The frame is made of 2mm thick high-strength steel, carefully designed and manufactured to ensure that it can withstand heavy loads and long-term use without deformation or damage. And the rubber base pads provide thoughtful protection for the floor. Max Weight Capacity:1000LBS.",
