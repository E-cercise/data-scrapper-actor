            "\u3010Stability & Versatile Workout\u3011This two-in-one leg press and hack squat machine, red model, adopts linear bearings rather than rolling ones, and it is constructed of heavy-duty high tensile beefy steel. Beyond that, there are two weight plate storage holders at the rear bottom, when stacked up, greatly enhance machine's stability when in motion. By adjusting the placement of your feet on the foot plate, you can focus more on training isolating muscle groups.",
            "\u3010Multiple Adjustments\u3011As a well-crafted design, there are 5 angle choices for hack squat and 3 for leg press setting, accomodating different sized athelets. The side rail (safety catches attached) handles can be pushed out to unlock the sled. After you are done with your set, pull both handles inward yourself to lock the sled in your designated lockout position. With a quick flip of the back pad and lowering of the leg press footplate, you can switch workouts in seconds to perform hack squat.",
            "\u3010Comfort & Smooth Exercise Experience\u3011This leg press and hack squat gym machine features thick shoulder and backrest cushion wrapped in premium anti-slip and wear-resistant leather surface, providing ultimate and long-lasting comfort to ease your strain and stress, and protecting your bones and joints during your bodybuilding. Solid metal guide rods (sled) and aluminium alloy grips on both sides upgrade your workout experience without jerk motions.",
            "\u3010Safety & Considerate Design\u3011The weight carriage fits 2'' plates, and Max 1200 lbs plate loading satisfies most users' needs. It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use. Two cushionings at the sled's bottom soften sudden impact with less noise. The triangular piece at the base of the back support also enhances overall stability.",
            "\u3010Separate Package\u3011Our leg press and hack squat machine will be shipped in two separate packages to minimize the possibility of wear and tear due to collisions. Your packages may arrive on different dates. If you only receive part of the shipment, please be patient as we continuously monitor your logistics status.

            "[Compact for Limited Space] The LP10 leg press and hack squat machine, with dimensions of 67 inches (L) x 52 inches (W) x 47 inches (H) and a footprint of only 24.2 sq. m., offers efficient space utilization. Compared to other large combo machines, this machine can save almost 1/3 of the space. The installation manual and video guide you through the assembly quickly. The LP10 is ideal for limited spaces such as a garage or home gym.",
            "[Unique 30\u00b0Combo Machine] Unlike the common 45\u00b0leg press hack squat combo machine on the market, we offer a unique 30\u00b0positive angle. The relaxed 30\u00b0position enables better isolation of the quadriceps, and it\u2019s friendly for individuals with insufficient lower back strength and knee joint issues. Compared to traditional squat racks and barbells, it\u2019s generally considered safer and more user-friendly.",
            "[Pocket-Friendly] Save your wallet without compromising the effectiveness of your leg workout.",
            "[Full Range of Motion] Another great feature of the LP10 leg press hack squat combo machine is its full range of motion, which allows you to achieve deeper depth in your squats, even allowing for an ATG squat. Most 45\u00b0combo machines have a seat pad installed under the guide rail for users to get support while doing leg press, but this overall squat range is limited. In comparison, the LP10 is definitely a wise choice.",
            "[Easy Adjustable, Easy Organize] The backboard and foot pedals can be adjusted in 7 angles respectively to target different muscle groups. The shoulder pad used for assisting hack squats is removable and has 3 adjustable positions to accommodate people of different heights. We also added a storage area at the back of the product to keep your weight plates organized. The band pegs allow you to use resistance bands for resistance training.",
            "[Stable Construction] The LP10 has excellent stability and smooth performance. The steel tubes of the rails are 3mm thick and very robust. With a maximum weight capacity of 1000 lbs, it's solid and reliable. Our unique stop-loss device, featuring 1 solid stopper and 5 adjustable hole positions, ensures 100% injury prevention. Each stopper can handle a weight of up to 500 lbs."

        "description": "Leg presses are a popular exercise in the realm of strength training and bodybuilding for several reasons. They offer a range of benefits that contribute to a well-rounded lower body workout and overall fitness. Here's why people incorporate leg presses into their exercise routines: Muscle Development - Leg presses primarily target the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps (front thigh muscles), hamstrings (back thigh muscles), glutes (buttocks), and calves. By performing leg presses, individuals can effectively develop and strengthen these muscles, leading to improved leg aesthetics and functionality. Isolation and Control - Leg presses allow for controlled and guided movements, minimizing the risk of injury due to poor form. This exercise isolates the lower body muscles, making it easier to focus on specific muscle groups and achieve better results. Variety and Customization - Leg press machines come with adjustable resistance, enabling users to customize the weight according to their fitness level and goals. This flexibility makes leg presses suitable for individuals of all experience levels, from beginners to advanced lifters. Lower Back Safety - Unlike some other leg exercises like squats, leg presses place less strain on the lower back. This makes them a preferred option for people with lower back issues or those looking to target their leg muscles without putting excessive stress on their back. Functional Strength - Strong leg muscles are essential for everyday activities such as walking, running, climbing stairs, and lifting objects. Leg presses help enhance lower body strength, improving overall functional fitness. Reduced Joint Impact - Leg presses are a lower-impact exercise compared to exercises like running or jumping, making them suitable for individuals with joint concerns or those recovering from injuries.",

The safety bar makes it easy to select the right height, making exercise more convenient and comfortable, and the design of the lowest lockout position reduces the risk of injury. The non-slip texture of the footboard increases friction and prevents displacement during exercise.",

It is also more suitable for people with knee injuries while ensuring normal hip rotation within a natural range of motion.",
            "Durable Construction - This product features a durable heavy-duty frame design with outstanding stability and reliability. The frame is made of 2mm thick high-strength steel, carefully designed and manufactured to ensure that it can withstand heavy loads and long-term use without deformation or damage. And the rubber base pads provide thoughtful protection for the floor. Max Weight Capacity:1000LBS.",
