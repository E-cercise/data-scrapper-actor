You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",

Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."
