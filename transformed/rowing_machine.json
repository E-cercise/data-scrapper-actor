The backlight function can monitor all exercise data in real time more clearly and effectively, such as heart rate, calories, number of rowing, rowing distance, etc.",
            "\u3010Exercise Full Body Muscle Groups\u3011Indoor rowing can exercise core muscle groups, increase endurance and burn calories more effectively. In just 20 minutes, you can exercise more than 90% of the major muscle groups, and you can exercise at any time without going outdoors to exercise or becoming a gym member.

            "Reliable Workout Data : The powerful PM5 Performance Monitor, standard with every RowErg, provides repeatable, comparable data for every workout. The PM5 offers a simple \u201cJust Row\u201d mode or allows you to set up a variety of workouts. The monitor shows you a wide range of data, including pace, watts, stroke rate and Calories and automatically stores this information in either its internal memory or a USB drive.",
            "Get Connected : One monitor, many training options! Our open-platform Performance Monitor connects via Bluetooth to your smartphone or tablet and is compatible with over 30 different apps, including our own ErgData. Whether you\u2019re after online classes, coaching and training programs or virtual racing, there\u2019s an app to suit you.",
            "Integrated Device Holder : Now it\u2019s easier than ever to use ErgData, or any of your other favorite apps, while rowing. Each new RowErg comes with a device holder that allows you to keep your smartphone or tablet securely in place. The device holder fits everything from small smartphones to large tablets such as the iPad Pro and is easily and quickly adjustable.",
            "One Machine, Two Height Options : Our standard RowErg has a 14\u201d seat height, while our elevated version has taller legs that provide a 20\u201d seat height. The elevated version is a good choice if you like the convenience and appearance of a taller machine. The increased seat height can also make it easier to get on and off.",
            "Flywheel and Damper : Our RowErgs use air resistance to respond to your effort on every stroke, so you are in full control of your exertion and resistance at all times. The spiral damper allows you to easily adjust the airflow to the flywheel, so you can change the feel of the stroke to suit your preference. The flywheel design minimizes noise while maximizing a smooth feel.",
            "Storage and Mobility : The RowErg is easy to wheel around for workouts and can be quickly separated into two pieces (no tools required) for compact storage. Ideal for homes or gyms that need flexible space. The taller legs of the elevated version feature large caster wheels for easier moving.",
            "Adjustable Footrests and Ergonomic Handle : Adjustable footrests allow for quick and easy sizing to fit a wide range of shoe sizes. We designed the ergonomic handle with a 10-degree bend that allows you to row comfortably with a natural arm and hand position."

        "description": "Two-in-One Cardio The Avari\u00ae Conversion II Rower/Recumbent Bike provides two low-impact cardiovascular workouts in one space-saving machine: cycling and rowing. Whether using the rowing machine to strengthen and tone your total body or the recumbent bike to firm your lower body, this magnetic resistance machine delivers a complete workout that's as hardcore - or not - as you want. To adjust the intensity mid routine, simply turn the grip-edged, 8-resistance-level dial to adjust your pace without interrupting the smooth, quiet workout. Switching from a stationary recumbent workout to indoor rowing - or vice versa - is a cinch. Just pull the pin and enjoy your workout as the padded seat glides along our ball bearing roller system for consistently smooth rowing at any resistance level. When you're ready to log some recumbent biking miles, adjust the seat to your leg length, re-insert the pin, start your healthy journey. More Tech for Your Buck The Avari\u00ae Conversion II Rower/Recumbent Bike features a multi-functional electronic fitness monitor that displays all the information you need to remain motivated. Track your speed, distance, time, odometer, heart rate and calories burned so you can keep an eye on the finish line and find the will to power through. When you're not testing your mettle and sculpting your body, simply fold the machine and store it out of the way for next time. Built to Accommodate You for Life In addition to quickly changing exercises modes and adjusting intensity & workout duration settings, the machine lets you just as easily adjust other settings for your body. The adjustable foot straps on both pairs of purposefully oversized foot pedals will securely hold your feet. While in bike mode, the foot straps allow a pulling motion that establishes an advantageous push/pull movement that many competing exercise bikes fail to provide. Similarly beneficial, the heavy-duty nylon rowing strap with foam hand grips offers stable, comfortable hand placement while rowing. Supported by m\u00fc\u00fcv This product includes free access to m\u00fc\u00fcv, the smart audio coaching app. m\u00fc\u00fcv helps you move 500+ minutes per month with the right mix of cardio, strength, and flexibility for a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. You'll get smart audio coaching that is personalized to you, progresses for you, and is fun to do. The all-in-one app comes with a follow-along assembly video, personalized workouts tailored to the equipment you own, and an ad-free music listening experience from iHeartRadio. Download the m\u00fc\u00fcv app on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store. Since the machine is equipped with an oversized aluminum seat rail/rowing beam that's engineered for extra durability and strength, you'll be able to row and ride for the rest of your life.",
