This machine is ideal for strength training, rehabilitation, or achieving aesthetic goals. \nWeight Capacity: Handles a maximum load of 350 lbs., catering to beginners and experienced athletes alike.\nCompact Design: With dimensions of 51.25\" x 25\" x 36\", this machine is space-efficient, making it perfect for home gyms and light-commercial setups.\nOptional Floor Mounting: For added safety and stability during heavy lifts, the machine can be floor-mounted.\nStrengthened calf muscles are essential for activities like running, jumping, and climbing. A strong soleus helps absorb impact, reducing the risk of injuries such as shin splints or Achilles tendon strains. Regular use of this machine also promotes better performance in sports and functional movements. \nThis machine offers the flexibility to incorporate calf raises into a variety of training regimens, from general fitness to specialized rehabilitation programs. Its compact design and adaptability make it suitable for athletes, physical therapy professionals, and personal trainers."

            "[Independent Dual Pulley System] Unlike the common power cage, the HR05 has an independent 1:1 ratio double pulley system on both sides of the frame. 1:1 means that the weight you train is the weight you load. And the weight capacity of power rack will double. The independent pulley system allows you to complete super set, drop set, co-training and other gym workouts without being limited by the home gym weight stack cap.",
            "[4-IN-1 Home Gym Partner] HR05 combines a power rack, multi-grip pull up bar, cable crossover machine and 360\u00b0 landmine into one machine. At the same time, the pulley system has been upgraded to give you a seamless and stable movement experience. The improved sliding sleeve ensures smooth operation while protecting the pulley from damage. Gross Weight: 205 lbs. The machine boasts a maximum capacity of up to 2000 lbs.",
            "[Unique Column] More holes have been drilled into the HR05 power cage's posts at 1-inch spacing, giving you a total of 30 height options. There are also digital markers on the side to help you locate quickly. In addition, we use the standard 2\"x 2\" column, which can be adapted to a variety of accessories on the market to unlock more training possibilities. The tube thickness of 2 mm effectively ensures the stability of the power rack.",
            "[Space-saving Design] Another major feature of the HR05 is the space savings, the frame design is closer to half rack, compared to most power racks, its space can be reduced by nearly two-thirds. In addition, we are equipped with more weight storage areas in the middle of HR05, which can not only effectively organize the space of the home gym, but also increase the stability of the shelves.",
            "[Fully equipped & versatile] The HR05 power cage comes with all the attachments you may need more of in your daily training. including 4 free handle attachments, 2 safety spotter pins, dip bars, j hooks, and T-bar row attachment. This provides a wide range of exercises, such as wide & narrow lat pull-downs, T-bar rows, seated cable rows, bench presses, squats, deadlifts, bicep curls, triceps extensions, pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, and more."

        "description": "Mikolo Power Cage, 2000LB Squat Rack, Dual Pulley Cable Crossover System, Multi-function Free Weight Home Gym Workout Machine with Attachments",
        "features": [
            "[Independent Dual Pulley System] Unlike the common power cage, the HR05 has an independent 1:1 ratio double pulley system on both sides of the frame. 1:1 means that the weight you train is the weight you load. And the weight capacity of power rack will double. The independent pulley system allows you to complete super set, drop set, co-training and other gym workouts without being limited by the home gym weight stack cap.",
            "[4-IN-1 Home Gym Partner] HR05 combines a power rack, multi-grip pull up bar, cable crossover machine and 360\u00b0 landmine into one machine. At the same time, the pulley system has been upgraded to give you a seamless and stable movement experience. The improved sliding sleeve ensures smooth operation while protecting the pulley from damage. Gross Weight: 205 lbs. The machine boasts a maximum capacity of up to 2000 lbs.",
            "[Unique Column] More holes have been drilled into the HR05 power cage's posts at 1-inch spacing, giving you a total of 30 height options. There are also digital markers on the side to help you locate quickly. In addition, we use the standard 2\"x 2\" column, which can be adapted to a variety of accessories on the market to unlock more training possibilities. The tube thickness of 2 mm effectively ensures the stability of the power rack.",
            "[Space-saving Design] Another major feature of the HR05 is the space savings, the frame design is closer to half rack, compared to most power racks, its space can be reduced by nearly two-thirds. In addition, we are equipped with more weight storage areas in the middle of HR05, which can not only effectively organize the space of the home gym, but also increase the stability of the shelves.",
            "[Fully equipped & versatile] The HR05 power cage comes with all the attachments you may need more of in your daily training. including 4 free handle attachments, 2 safety spotter pins, dip bars, j hooks, and T-bar row attachment. This provides a wide range of exercises, such as wide & narrow lat pull-downs, T-bar rows, seated cable rows, bench presses, squats, deadlifts, bicep curls, triceps extensions, pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, and more."

By standing in a slant position on this board, you improve the performance of your muscles for exercise and cut down on cases of injury. If you're an athlete or someone suffering from Achilles tendon injuries, this board will help to relieve the pain. \nWhat are the Benefits of a Slant Board? \nAny health-conscious person will be quick to learn the advantages of this simple yet powerful device. Do you know why? A slant board is useful not leg-related pains and injuries, but also for proper blood circulation and the relief of back pain. Here are the benefits of using a slant board. \nThe calf plays a great role in our daily activities and movement such as running, walking, jumping, and standing. Hence, you need a slant board to help you stretch them and make them flexible.\nIt helps to prevent inflammation which often comes with pain.\nUsing a slant board allows you to protect the Achilles tendon which is the strongest tendon in the body.\nIt's also useful for relieving the stress around muscles which tend to ache after exercise.\nPreventive medicine also values slant boards to ensure that possible leg injuries are avoided.\nA slant board helps in the circulation of blood to the leg to prevent swellings.",

Can I just wear socks? \nThe ProStretch should be used while wearing shoes with a supportive, rubber sole. \nWhat if my foot hangs off of the ProStretch? \nProStretch Original is intended for shoe sizes 12 or below. If your foot hangs off, that is absolutely fine. You are still able to obtain full use of the device even if it may look a little funny. \nWhy is the ProStretch better than just normal stretching (on a wall, steps, or a curb)? \nThe ProStretch holds your foot in an optimal angle to get a superior stretch. \nWhat is the difference between the ProStretch & the ProStretch Plus? \nThe ProStretch Original weight limit is 250 pounds & fits shoe sizes up to 12. The ProStretch Plus is a little longer and wider which accommodates up to shoe size 14 and a weight limit of 300 pounds. It's adjustable with a removeable toe lift. \nDo I have to stand while using the ProStretch or can it be used in a seated position? \nThe ProStretch can be used to provide therapy for a number of indications.

The squat is the ultimate exercise for building mass and strength in your thighs, glutes, calves, and lower back. This squat machine is designed to handle massive weight loads of over 800 pounds (Olympic weight plates sold separately), and it is specifically engineered to help to eliminate the risks of this essential exercise while enhancing its benefits and increasing its effectiveness. The heavy-gauge diamond plate foot platform is set to a perfect 20-degree pitch, delivering optimal development of the quadriceps and glutes. The innovative calf raise block is round instead of square, eliminating the painful edge and providing a deep pre-stretch for maximum calf-blasting workouts.

This squat machine is constructed with an extra-large 3- by 3-inch high-tensile-strength mainframe made with 12-gauge steel welded on all four sides, allowing it to stand up to massive workloads in high-traffic gyms and clubs. When assembled, the Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine measures 62 by 43 by 56 inches (L x W x H) and weighs 170 pounds. It is backed by the Body-Solid Lifetime In-Home and Full Commercial .",

        "description": "The Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine (GSCL360) handles the heaviest loads with ease to help you develop explosive lower-body power. The squat is the ultimate exercise for building mass and strength in your thighs, glutes, calves, and lower back. This squat machine is designed to handle massive weight loads of over 800 pounds (Olympic weight plates sold separately), and it is specifically engineered to help to eliminate the risks of this essential exercise while enhancing its benefits and increasing its effectiveness. The heavy-gauge diamond plate foot platform is set to a perfect 20-degree pitch, delivering optimal development of the quadriceps and glutes. The innovative calf raise block is round instead of square, eliminating the painful edge and providing a deep pre-stretch for maximum calf-blasting workouts. Exclusive DuraFirm shoulder pads are engineered to conform to the shoulders and back for a safe and secure fit during the heaviest lifts. This squat machine is constructed with an extra-large 3- by 3-inch high-tensile-strength mainframe made with 12-gauge steel welded on all four sides, allowing it to stand up to massive workloads in high-traffic gyms and clubs. When assembled, the Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine measures 62 by 43 by 56 inches (L x W x H) and weighs 170 pounds. It is backed by the Body-Solid Lifetime In-Home and Full Commercial .",

        "description": "The Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine (GSCL360) handles the heaviest loads with ease to help you develop explosive lower-body power. The squat is the ultimate exercise for building mass and strength in your thighs, glutes, calves, and lower back. This squat machine is designed to handle massive weight loads of over 800 pounds (Olympic weight plates sold separately), and it is specifically engineered to help to eliminate the risks of this essential exercise while enhancing its benefits and increasing its effectiveness. The heavy-gauge diamond plate foot platform is set to a perfect 20-degree pitch, delivering optimal development of the quadriceps and glutes. The innovative calf raise block is round instead of square, eliminating the painful edge and providing a deep pre-stretch for maximum calf-blasting workouts. Exclusive DuraFirm shoulder pads are engineered to conform to the shoulders and back for a safe and secure fit during the heaviest lifts. This squat machine is constructed with an extra-large 3- by 3-inch high-tensile-strength mainframe made with 12-gauge steel welded on all four sides, allowing it to stand up to massive workloads in high-traffic gyms and clubs. When assembled, the Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine measures 62 by 43 by 56 inches (L x W x H) and weighs 170 pounds. It is backed by the Body-Solid Lifetime In-Home and Full Commercial .",

        "description": "The Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine (GSCL360) handles the heaviest loads with ease to help you develop explosive lower-body power. The squat is the ultimate exercise for building mass and strength in your thighs, glutes, calves, and lower back. This squat machine is designed to handle massive weight loads of over 800 pounds (Olympic weight plates sold separately), and it is specifically engineered to help to eliminate the risks of this essential exercise while enhancing its benefits and increasing its effectiveness. The heavy-gauge diamond plate foot platform is set to a perfect 20-degree pitch, delivering optimal development of the quadriceps and glutes. The innovative calf raise block is round instead of square, eliminating the painful edge and providing a deep pre-stretch for maximum calf-blasting workouts. Exclusive DuraFirm shoulder pads are engineered to conform to the shoulders and back for a safe and secure fit during the heaviest lifts. This squat machine is constructed with an extra-large 3- by 3-inch high-tensile-strength mainframe made with 12-gauge steel welded on all four sides, allowing it to stand up to massive workloads in high-traffic gyms and clubs. When assembled, the Body-Solid Leverage Squat and Calf Raise Machine measures 62 by 43 by 56 inches (L x W x H) and weighs 170 pounds. It is backed by the Body-Solid Lifetime In-Home and Full Commercial .",

                    "text": "When it comes to exercise and stretching, the calf muscles typically don\u2019t receive the amount of attention they deserve. However, our calves provide significant support to the lower body and are used in a wide range of activities, such as standing on your toes when you\u2019re trying to reach something up high and walking. Because our calf muscles experience frequent use, they can easily become tense and create health problems, such as patellar tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, shin splints, knee pain, heel pain, and general foot pain. The aforementioned conditions are the very reason the Slant Board was developed. Multiple studies have indicated that using a Slant Board is a highly effective way to increase flexibility and relieve tightness in your calves. \nOur Slant Board, also referred to as an Incline Board or Calf Stretch Board, is made of strong, durable plywood with birch wood veneer. The incline of the board can be adjusted to 4 angle adjustments: 10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees. Our Slant Board features a firm, non-slip surface for foot placement as well as a non-skid surface on the bottom of the board. With an updated safe and simple locking system and pre-drilled holes to store locking screws our calf stretcher sets the standard for professional quality and design. With its extremely simple design and construction-quality hardware, our board will flip open and then fold closed for easy portability.

            "Comprehensive Security - V squat machine provides a fixed motion trajectory, which can help to accurately control the body's posture and avoid injuries caused by wrong posture during free squat. The safety bar makes it easy to select the right height, making exercise more convenient and comfortable, and the design of the lowest lockout position reduces the risk of injury. The non-slip texture of the footboard increases friction and prevents displacement during exercise.",
            "Beyond the Traditional - Compared with traditional Hack Squat machines, the V Squat Machine provides greater stability and spreads the load more evenly throughout the lower limb muscle group to better balance the upper and middle leg joints. It is also more suitable for people with knee injuries while ensuring normal hip rotation within a natural range of motion.",
            "Durable Construction - This product features a durable heavy-duty frame design with outstanding stability and reliability. The frame is made of 2mm thick high-strength steel, carefully designed and manufactured to ensure that it can withstand heavy loads and long-term use without deformation or damage. And the rubber base pads provide thoughtful protection for the floor. Max Weight Capacity:1000LBS.",
            "Lower Extremity Strength Training - This innovative fitness equipment allows for easy targeting of the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves through a variety of exercises. It\u2019s the perfect choice for building leg strength, improving balance and stability, and sculpting a beautifully toned lower body."

            "Comprehensive Security - V squat machine provides a fixed motion trajectory, which can help to accurately control the body's posture and avoid injuries caused by wrong posture during free squat. The safety bar makes it easy to select the right height, making exercise more convenient and comfortable, and the design of the lowest lockout position reduces the risk of injury. The non-slip texture of the footboard increases friction and prevents displacement during exercise.",
            "Beyond the Traditional - Compared with traditional Hack Squat machines, the V Squat Machine provides greater stability and spreads the load more evenly throughout the lower limb muscle group to better balance the upper and middle leg joints. It is also more suitable for people with knee injuries while ensuring normal hip rotation within a natural range of motion.",
            "Durable Construction - This product features a durable heavy-duty frame design with outstanding stability and reliability. The frame is made of 2mm thick high-strength steel, carefully designed and manufactured to ensure that it can withstand heavy loads and long-term use without deformation or damage. And the rubber base pads provide thoughtful protection for the floor. Max Weight Capacity:1000LBS.",
            "Lower Extremity Strength Training - This innovative fitness equipment allows for easy targeting of the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves through a variety of exercises. It\u2019s the perfect choice for building leg strength, improving balance and stability, and sculpting a beautifully toned lower body."

            "This vertical leg press machine is made of 50 x 100 mm, 14 gauge high quality steel. Gross weight: 94 lbs. Weight capacity: 550lbs. User height: higher than 5.3''.",
            "Cost & Space Saving Choice: The GMWD vertical leg press machine is an excellent space saving machine. It's great for those who want to do leg press but don't have much space at home. Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad. Laying flat on the back pad, horizontally to the ground, your lower back, upper back, and neck, are almost completely left out of it. This can minimize lower back rounding and maintain your spine's natural curve. 5\u00b0Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising.",
            "Liner Bearing Design: Unlike other brands\u2019 nylon bushings or roller bearings, we updated liner bearings. \"Linear bearing\" means a higher cost for GMWD but a better feeling for you. You won't feel any clogged while you're exercising. Start your leg training more coherently and smoothly.",
            "3 start and end positions can meet the needs of people with different heights. Adjustable height range: 47.8'' to 62''. All your family members can enjoy the fun of leg strength training.",
            "This leg press machine has 3 weight posts to help you add weights to your training. The detachable sleeves can fit both 1'' & 2'' plates.",
            "Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising. Leaflike texture for better slip resistance."

            "Cost & Space Saving Choice: The GMWD vertical leg press machine is an excellent space saving machine. It's great for those who want to do leg press but don't have much space at home. Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad. Laying flat on the back pad, horizontally to the ground, your lower back, upper back, and neck, are almost completely left out of it. This can minimize lower back rounding and maintain your spine's natural curve. 5\u00b0Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising.",
            "Liner Bearing Design: Unlike other brands\u2019 nylon bushings or roller bearings, we updated liner bearings. \"Linear bearing\" means a higher cost for GMWD but a better feeling for you. You won't feel any clogged while you're exercising. Start your leg training more coherently and smoothly.",
            "3 start and end positions can meet the needs of people with different heights. Adjustable height range: 47.8'' to 62''. All your family members can enjoy the fun of leg strength training.",

With shoes on, or off, place your heel into the heel lock and gently lean forward towards the door frame. As your calf stretches, pull yourself closer to the frame to deepen the stretch. \nIs the angle adjustable? \nNo, The device is designed to be one angle so that your calf length can be the variable. The closer you come to the wall, the deeper the stretch. The angle was designed to work for all people tall & short, young & old & should not be adjusted \nHow does the CalfPRO differ from traditional calf stretching methods? \nUnlike manual stretching or basic equipment, the CalfPRO offers users unparalleled control over the stretching process by allowing them to lock in the back of the heel, ensuring a targeted stretch of the calf muscles every time. \nCan the CalfPRO be used by individuals of all fitness levels, including beginners? \nYes! Beginners can increase the intensity of the stretch as their flexibility improves over time. The CalfPRO's ergonomic design helps minimize strain on the body, making it great for users who may be new to stretching or have limited flexibility. \nCan the CalfPRO be easily stored when not in use? \nWhether you're using it at home, in the gym, or on the go, the CalfPRO can be quickly and easily stowed away thanks to its collapsible design, making it a convenient addition to any fitness routine.",

They'll help you increase your squat depth and range of motion, taking 'leg day' to a whole new level. \nMax Out Quad Engagement \nRaising your heels with these wedges will help you fully engage your muscles, particularly the quads and glutes, so you'll feel the burn in all the right places, maximizing strength and growth. \nMakes It Easy to Squat Safely \nMany lifters struggle with maintaining proper squat form, but these innovative ramps make it easy to keep a balanced posture throughout the movement, taking the strain off your back, knees, and hips. \nNot Just for Smarter Squatting \nAnother big benefit of these wedge blocks is their versatility. They allow you to engage different muscle groups, making Pilates, stretching, push-ups, deadlifts, and lunges even more challenging and effective. \nTough, but Not a Drag to Carry \nThey're made from high-density rubber and can support up to 2,000 lbs without breaking a sweat. But despite their impressive strength, the hollowed design makes them surprisingly lightweight and portable. \nNon-Slip & Simple to Adjust \nOur squat wedge blocks have a non-slip surface, so you stay firmly planted throughout your entire lift. They're also adjustable, allowing you to quickly modify the angle to three different heights: 25\u00b0 (10\u00b0 + 15\u00b0). \nDesigned for Every Foot Size \nEach weightlifting wedge measures 8.5\" L x 5.7\" W x 3.77\" H, making them the perfect fit for feet small and large. They're compact enough to store easily, but large enough to provide a stable, secure base. \nBlocks + Bands = Epic Gains \nOur adjustable squat wedges also come with two premium resistance bands. They'll help you increase resistance during squats, target different muscle groups, and incorporate full-body exercises.",

            "rawText": "Product Description\nGet More Out of Every Rep \nOnce you start squatting with these wedge blocks, you won\u2019t go back to doing it flat-footed. They'll help you increase your squat depth and range of motion, taking 'leg day' to a whole new level. \nMax Out Quad Engagement \nRaising your heels with these wedges will help you fully engage your muscles, particularly the quads and glutes, so you'll feel the burn in all the right places, maximizing strength and growth. \nMakes It Easy to Squat Safely \nMany lifters struggle with maintaining proper squat form, but these innovative ramps make it easy to keep a balanced posture throughout the movement, taking the strain off your back, knees, and hips. \nNot Just for Smarter Squatting \nAnother big benefit of these wedge blocks is their versatility. They allow you to engage different muscle groups, making Pilates, stretching, push-ups, deadlifts, and lunges even more challenging and effective. \nTough, but Not a Drag to Carry \nThey're made from high-density rubber and can support up to 2,000 lbs without breaking a sweat. But despite their impressive strength, the hollowed design makes them surprisingly lightweight and portable. \nNon-Slip & Simple to Adjust \nOur squat wedge blocks have a non-slip surface, so you stay firmly planted throughout your entire lift. They're also adjustable, allowing you to quickly modify the angle to three different heights: 25\u00b0 (10\u00b0 + 15\u00b0). \nDesigned for Every Foot Size \nEach weightlifting wedge measures 8.5\" L x 5.7\" W x 3.77\" H, making them the perfect fit for feet small and large. They're compact enough to store easily, but large enough to provide a stable, secure base. \nBlocks + Bands = Epic Gains \nOur adjustable squat wedges also come with two premium resistance bands. They'll help you increase resistance during squats, target different muscle groups, and incorporate full-body exercises.",

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, the Squat Wedge is an essential addition to your workout routine. \nIf you struggle with limited ankle dorsiflexion, our Squat Wedge helps increase your range of motion, allowing your knees to travel further forward while keeping your heels grounded. This enables deeper, more effective squats without compromising your form. \nThe Squat Wedge assists in maintaining proper squat technique by encouraging proper knee tracking and reducing the tendency to lean forward too much. This means less strain on your lower back and more focus on building strength in your legs and glutes. \nFor those with tight calves or ankle mobility issues, the Squat Wedge can alleviate discomfort during squats by promoting a more natural movement pattern. It\u2019s perfect for preventing knee pain, lower back strain, or ankle discomfort often experienced during deep squats. \nBy lifting your heels slightly, the Squat Wedge allows you to squat deeper with better balance and control. This improved depth results in better muscle activation, particularly targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. \nMade from high-quality, durable materials, our Squat Wedge is designed to last. Its compact, portable size makes it easy to use at home or in the gym.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, the Squat Wedge is an essential addition to your workout routine. \nIf you struggle with limited ankle dorsiflexion, our Squat Wedge helps increase your range of motion, allowing your knees to travel further forward while keeping your heels grounded. This enables deeper, more effective squats without compromising your form. \nThe Squat Wedge assists in maintaining proper squat technique by encouraging proper knee tracking and reducing the tendency to lean forward too much. This means less strain on your lower back and more focus on building strength in your legs and glutes. \nFor those with tight calves or ankle mobility issues, the Squat Wedge can alleviate discomfort during squats by promoting a more natural movement pattern. It\u2019s perfect for preventing knee pain, lower back strain, or ankle discomfort often experienced during deep squats. \nBy lifting your heels slightly, the Squat Wedge allows you to squat deeper with better balance and control. This improved depth results in better muscle activation, particularly targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. \nMade from high-quality, durable materials, our Squat Wedge is designed to last. Its compact, portable size makes it easy to use at home or in the gym. Whether you're training for strength, mobility, or overall fitness, it\u2019s the perfect addition to your workout gear."

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, the Squat Wedge is an essential addition to your workout routine. \nIf you struggle with limited ankle dorsiflexion, our Squat Wedge helps increase your range of motion, allowing your knees to travel further forward while keeping your heels grounded. This enables deeper, more effective squats without compromising your form. \nThe Squat Wedge assists in maintaining proper squat technique by encouraging proper knee tracking and reducing the tendency to lean forward too much. This means less strain on your lower back and more focus on building strength in your legs and glutes. \nFor those with tight calves or ankle mobility issues, the Squat Wedge can alleviate discomfort during squats by promoting a more natural movement pattern. It\u2019s perfect for preventing knee pain, lower back strain, or ankle discomfort often experienced during deep squats. \nBy lifting your heels slightly, the Squat Wedge allows you to squat deeper with better balance and control. This improved depth results in better muscle activation, particularly targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. \nMade from high-quality, durable materials, our Squat Wedge is designed to last. Its compact, portable size makes it easy to use at home or in the gym. Whether you're training for strength, mobility, or overall fitness, it\u2019s the perfect addition to your workout gear. \nNonslip \nNonslip textures on both sides for more grip \nHigh Weight Capacity \nOver 1200lbs weight capacity for most exercises \nVisible Height Marks \n2 heights marks for accuratly exercises \nPortable \nCome with carry bag for more portability \nPick Your Own Wedges \nAdjustable Metal Squat Wedge \nAdjustable Rubber Squat Wedge \nNonslip Squat Wedge \nMaterial \nPremium Metal \n\t\nMaterial \nOdourless Rubber \n\t\nMaterial \nHigh Quality Polypropylene \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \n5 Height Options \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \n3 Height Options \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \nNot Applicable \n\t\nWeight Capacity \nOver 2500lbs \n\t\nWeight Capacity \n2000lbs \n\t\nWeight Capacity \n1200lbs \n\t\nPortability \nNot very portable \n\t\nPortability \nAround 5lbs, easy to carry \n\t\nPortability \nAround 2lbs, for more portability",

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, the Squat Wedge is an essential addition to your workout routine. \nIf you struggle with limited ankle dorsiflexion, our Squat Wedge helps increase your range of motion, allowing your knees to travel further forward while keeping your heels grounded. This enables deeper, more effective squats without compromising your form. \nThe Squat Wedge assists in maintaining proper squat technique by encouraging proper knee tracking and reducing the tendency to lean forward too much. This means less strain on your lower back and more focus on building strength in your legs and glutes. \nFor those with tight calves or ankle mobility issues, the Squat Wedge can alleviate discomfort during squats by promoting a more natural movement pattern. It\u2019s perfect for preventing knee pain, lower back strain, or ankle discomfort often experienced during deep squats. \nBy lifting your heels slightly, the Squat Wedge allows you to squat deeper with better balance and control. This improved depth results in better muscle activation, particularly targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. \nMade from high-quality, durable materials, our Squat Wedge is designed to last. Its compact, portable size makes it easy to use at home or in the gym. Whether you're training for strength, mobility, or overall fitness, it\u2019s the perfect addition to your workout gear. \nNonslip \nNonslip textures on both sides for more grip \nHigh Weight Capacity \nOver 1200lbs weight capacity for most exercises \nVisible Height Marks \n2 heights marks for accuratly exercises \nPortable \nCome with carry bag for more portability \nPick Your Own Wedges \nAdjustable Metal Squat Wedge \nAdjustable Rubber Squat Wedge \nNonslip Squat Wedge \nMaterial \nPremium Metal \n\t\nMaterial \nOdourless Rubber \n\t\nMaterial \nHigh Quality Polypropylene \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \n5 Height Options \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \n3 Height Options \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \nNot Applicable \n\t\nWeight Capacity \nOver 2500lbs \n\t\nWeight Capacity \n2000lbs \n\t\nWeight Capacity \n1200lbs \n\t\nPortability \nNot very portable \n\t\nPortability \nAround 5lbs, easy to carry \n\t\nPortability \nAround 2lbs, for more portability",

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, the Squat Wedge is an essential addition to your workout routine. \nIf you struggle with limited ankle dorsiflexion, our Squat Wedge helps increase your range of motion, allowing your knees to travel further forward while keeping your heels grounded. This enables deeper, more effective squats without compromising your form. \nThe Squat Wedge assists in maintaining proper squat technique by encouraging proper knee tracking and reducing the tendency to lean forward too much. This means less strain on your lower back and more focus on building strength in your legs and glutes. \nFor those with tight calves or ankle mobility issues, the Squat Wedge can alleviate discomfort during squats by promoting a more natural movement pattern. It\u2019s perfect for preventing knee pain, lower back strain, or ankle discomfort often experienced during deep squats. \nBy lifting your heels slightly, the Squat Wedge allows you to squat deeper with better balance and control. This improved depth results in better muscle activation, particularly targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. \nMade from high-quality, durable materials, our Squat Wedge is designed to last. Its compact, portable size makes it easy to use at home or in the gym. Whether you're training for strength, mobility, or overall fitness, it\u2019s the perfect addition to your workout gear."

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, the Squat Wedge is an essential addition to your workout routine. \nIf you struggle with limited ankle dorsiflexion, our Squat Wedge helps increase your range of motion, allowing your knees to travel further forward while keeping your heels grounded. This enables deeper, more effective squats without compromising your form. \nThe Squat Wedge assists in maintaining proper squat technique by encouraging proper knee tracking and reducing the tendency to lean forward too much. This means less strain on your lower back and more focus on building strength in your legs and glutes. \nFor those with tight calves or ankle mobility issues, the Squat Wedge can alleviate discomfort during squats by promoting a more natural movement pattern. It\u2019s perfect for preventing knee pain, lower back strain, or ankle discomfort often experienced during deep squats. \nBy lifting your heels slightly, the Squat Wedge allows you to squat deeper with better balance and control. This improved depth results in better muscle activation, particularly targeting the quads, hamstrings, and glutes. \nMade from high-quality, durable materials, our Squat Wedge is designed to last. Its compact, portable size makes it easy to use at home or in the gym. Whether you're training for strength, mobility, or overall fitness, it\u2019s the perfect addition to your workout gear. \nNonslip \nNonslip textures on both sides for more grip \nHigh Weight Capacity \nOver 1200lbs weight capacity for most exercises \nVisible Height Marks \n2 heights marks for accuratly exercises \nPortable \nCome with carry bag for more portability \nPick Your Own Wedges \nAdjustable Metal Squat Wedge \nAdjustable Rubber Squat Wedge \nNonslip Squat Wedge \nMaterial \nPremium Metal \n\t\nMaterial \nOdourless Rubber \n\t\nMaterial \nHigh Quality Polypropylene \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \n5 Height Options \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \n3 Height Options \n\t\nHeight Adjustable \nNot Applicable \n\t\nWeight Capacity \nOver 2500lbs \n\t\nWeight Capacity \n2000lbs \n\t\nWeight Capacity \n1200lbs \n\t\nPortability \nNot very portable \n\t\nPortability \nAround 5lbs, easy to carry \n\t\nPortability \nAround 2lbs, for more portability",

            "Improved Athletic Performance: Strong calves are essential for activities that require running, jumping, and explosive movements, such as sprinting, basketball, soccer, and dancing. Powerful calf muscles provide the necessary propulsion and stability to excel in these activities.",
            "Prevention of Injury: Strong calves help to stabilize the ankles and lower legs, reducing the risk of injuries such as ankle sprains, Achilles tendonitis, and shin splints. They also absorb shock during high-impact activities, protecting the joints and bones from excessive stress.",
            "Enhanced Balance and Stability: Well-developed calf muscles contribute to overall balance and stability, particularly during activities that require changes in direction or quick movements. They help maintain proper alignment of the lower body, reducing the risk of falls and improving coordination.",
            "Functional Movement: Strong calves are essential for everyday movements such as walking, climbing stairs, and standing for long periods. They provide the necessary strength and endurance to perform these tasks efficiently and without fatigue.",
            "Aesthetic Appeal: Well-defined calf muscles can enhance the appearance of the legs, creating a more sculpted and toned look. This can boost confidence and self-esteem, especially for individuals who engage in activities where leg aesthetics are important, such as bodybuilding or fitness competitions."

            "Improved Athletic Performance: Strong calves are essential for activities that require running, jumping, and explosive movements, such as sprinting, basketball, soccer, and dancing. Powerful calf muscles provide the necessary propulsion and stability to excel in these activities.",
            "Prevention of Injury: Strong calves help to stabilize the ankles and lower legs, reducing the risk of injuries such as ankle sprains, Achilles tendonitis, and shin splints. They also absorb shock during high-impact activities, protecting the joints and bones from excessive stress.",
            "Enhanced Balance and Stability: Well-developed calf muscles contribute to overall balance and stability, particularly during activities that require changes in direction or quick movements. They help maintain proper alignment of the lower body, reducing the risk of falls and improving coordination.",
            "Functional Movement: Strong calves are essential for everyday movements such as walking, climbing stairs, and standing for long periods. They provide the necessary strength and endurance to perform these tasks efficiently and without fatigue.",
            "Aesthetic Appeal: Well-defined calf muscles can enhance the appearance of the legs, creating a more sculpted and toned look. This can boost confidence and self-esteem, especially for individuals who engage in activities where leg aesthetics are important, such as bodybuilding or fitness competitions."

This small muscle is very important for our sports, especially for those who participate in running or jumping activities. The strong and relaxed tibialis anterior muscle can help counteract the negative impact of the high impact force of the feet constantly hitting the ground. \nReduce the risk of calf, ankle and foot injuries \nReduce the chance of anterior tibial tendinitis \nLow risk of shin splinting pain & stress fractures \nThe video showcases the product in use.The video guides you through product setup.The video compares multiple products.The video shows the product being unpacked.\nFitarc Tib Bar Assembly \nHere is the instruction of assembling Fitarc Tib Bar \n\nPlease don't worry about assembly problems, we are equipped with installation videos and instructions, you can check them at any time. \n4 Foam Pads \nDifferent from others, in order to make exercise more comfortable, we have added 2 foam pads on the original basis to give you a better experience. \nHigh-Quality Snap \nFITARC use high quality snap, tight and reliable. Effectively fix the barbell plate to prevent back and forth shaking. \nLimit Pin \nThe special design prevents the buckle from slipping due to the excessive weight of the weight plate, double protection and fixation. \n2 inch / 1 inch diameter \nUse 9\" Extension Loading Bar, 2 sizes to choose from. Suitable for 2 inch Plates or 1 inch dumbbell pieces (depending on the size you purchase). \nHow to Use Tib Bar? \nPlace the weight plate with a 2-inch hole diameter on the bar, and fasten it with the snap and limit pins. Sitting on a flat surface, you need to support your thighs and knees and straighten your calves. Then tib bar hooks easily over the end of the foot for full rotation of the ankle up and down. \nKettlebell Replacement \nSit-ups (fixed) \nIs the collar easy to use? Is it too tight? \nA little tight but holds the weight plates firmly. \nI lost a screw, what should I do? \nI lost one recently during disassembling, contacted the seller and they sent me a screw set right away. \nAre the bars welded vertically? Will it be crooked? I've seen this problem reflected in the reviews of other brands. \nMine is normal, and I don\u2019t feel the weight tilting in any direction when using it. \nHas it been effective? \nI've been using it for a few days and feel a noticeable improvement on my shin muscles, so I'm ready to work on my knees and ankles next. \nDo I need to install the foam myself? \nNo, the seller has already installed it. I have purchased WIN*** before. It is not convenient to remove and replace, and the foam is not as big as that of Fitarc. \nOther products of Fitarc store \n\t\nJoist Pull Up Bar \nAdd to Cart \nSandbag \nAdd to Cart \nBurn machine \nAdd to Cart \nMultiHandle \nAdd to Cart \nBarbell Hanger \nAdd to Cart \nPull Up Assistance Bands \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.4 out of 5 stars \n101 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n97 \n\t\n4.8 out of 5 stars \n137 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n11 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n43 \n\t\nPrice \n\t$39.99$39.99 \t$43.99$43.99 \t$119.99$119.99 \t$29.99$29.99 \t$13.99$13.99 \t$29.99$29.99 \t\nColor \n\tBlack \tBlack, green \tSilver \tBlack \tBlack \tBlack \t\nFunction \n\tPull up, chin up \tWeightlifting, Fitness \tExercise arm strength \tPull up,Deadlift,Rowing \tBarbell Hanger \tIncrease the assistant force \t\nMaterials \n\tSteel \tNylon fabric \tStainless steel \tCarbon Steel \tIron \tNylon fabric \t\nExercise area \n\tUpper Body \tBody \tArms \tBody \tHanger \tBody \t\nSpecification \n\tJoist mount \t50lb, 100lb, 150lb \t12lb \tWeight Capacity 350lb \t1 hook, 2 hook, 3 hook \t14 Levels, Up to 300LBS",

This small muscle is very important for our sports, especially for those who participate in running or jumping activities. The strong and relaxed tibialis anterior muscle can help counteract the negative impact of the high impact force of the feet constantly hitting the ground. \nReduce the risk of calf, ankle and foot injuries \nReduce the chance of anterior tibial tendinitis \nLow risk of shin splinting pain & stress fractures \nThe video showcases the product in use.The video guides you through product setup.The video compares multiple products.The video shows the product being unpacked.\nFitarc Tib Bar Assembly \nHere is the instruction of assembling Fitarc Tib Bar \n\nPlease don't worry about assembly problems, we are equipped with installation videos and instructions, you can check them at any time. \n4 Foam Pads \nDifferent from others, in order to make exercise more comfortable, we have added 2 foam pads on the original basis to give you a better experience. \nHigh-Quality Snap \nFITARC use high quality snap, tight and reliable. Effectively fix the barbell plate to prevent back and forth shaking. \nLimit Pin \nThe special design prevents the buckle from slipping due to the excessive weight of the weight plate, double protection and fixation. \n2 inch / 1 inch diameter \nUse 9\" Extension Loading Bar, 2 sizes to choose from. Suitable for 2 inch Plates or 1 inch dumbbell pieces (depending on the size you purchase). \nHow to Use Tib Bar? \nPlace the weight plate with a 2-inch hole diameter on the bar, and fasten it with the snap and limit pins. Sitting on a flat surface, you need to support your thighs and knees and straighten your calves. Then tib bar hooks easily over the end of the foot for full rotation of the ankle up and down. \nKettlebell Replacement \nSit-ups (fixed) \nIs the collar easy to use? Is it too tight? \nA little tight but holds the weight plates firmly. \nI lost a screw, what should I do? \nI lost one recently during disassembling, contacted the seller and they sent me a screw set right away. \nAre the bars welded vertically? Will it be crooked? I've seen this problem reflected in the reviews of other brands. \nMine is normal, and I don\u2019t feel the weight tilting in any direction when using it. \nHas it been effective? \nI've been using it for a few days and feel a noticeable improvement on my shin muscles, so I'm ready to work on my knees and ankles next. \nDo I need to install the foam myself? \nNo, the seller has already installed it. I have purchased WIN*** before. It is not convenient to remove and replace, and the foam is not as big as that of Fitarc. \nOther products of Fitarc store \n\t\nJoist Pull Up Bar \nAdd to Cart \nSandbag \nAdd to Cart \nBurn machine \nAdd to Cart \nMultiHandle \nAdd to Cart \nBarbell Hanger \nAdd to Cart \nPull Up Assistance Bands \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.4 out of 5 stars \n101 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n97 \n\t\n4.8 out of 5 stars \n137 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n11 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n43 \n\t\nPrice \n\t$39.99$39.99 \t$43.99$43.99 \t$119.99$119.99 \t$29.99$29.99 \t$13.99$13.99 \t$29.99$29.99 \t\nColor \n\tBlack \tBlack, green \tSilver \tBlack \tBlack \tBlack \t\nFunction \n\tPull up, chin up \tWeightlifting, Fitness \tExercise arm strength \tPull up,Deadlift,Rowing \tBarbell Hanger \tIncrease the assistant force \t\nMaterials \n\tSteel \tNylon fabric \tStainless steel \tCarbon Steel \tIron \tNylon fabric \t\nExercise area \n\tUpper Body \tBody \tArms \tBody \tHanger \tBody \t\nSpecification \n\tJoist mount \t50lb, 100lb, 150lb \t12lb \tWeight Capacity 350lb \t1 hook, 2 hook, 3 hook \t14 Levels, Up to 300LBS",
