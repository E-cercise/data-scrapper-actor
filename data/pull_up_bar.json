The height can be adjusted across multiple levels from 46.45'' to 101.57'' (118 to 258cm) without needing a spanner, allowing for full-body stretches and swings. Suitable for users up to 6.56 ft (200cm) and 485 lbs (200kg), it supports various workouts, including kipping pull-ups, muscle-ups, and more.",

            "Ultra-Light and Highly Portable: Unlike traditional bulky steel stands, the KT1.1520-ALU pull-up bar stand is crafted from high-strength aluminum alloy, weighing just 26.45 lbs (11 kg).

Its versatile uses include pull-ups, chin-ups, hanging leg raises, sit-ups and crunches. As you gain strength, it is easy to add more variations and difficulty into your Pull-up Bar exercises. With the Maximiza, you need minimal space in your house to do highly effective bodyweight exercises. The heavy-duty chrome steel bar and the multiple screw-in door mounts provide safety and stability while giving you the flexibility to move it to different places or heights. The non-slip extra-long foam grips provide a firm grip and extra comfort to minimize hand fatigue. The Maximiza Doorway Pull Up Bar is adjustable to fit wide doorways between 35 and 50 inches when extended. It comes with 3 sets of heavy-duty door mounts which can be screwed into up to 3 wooden doorframes in your house.

            "Before purchasing, ensure your door frame width is between 30-37.4 inches (76 to 95 cm). This chin up bar is not suitable for frames outside this range. The door frame must be wider than the anti-slip pads at both ends of the bar",
            "To ensure safety, the manual specifies a maximum load of 297 lbs (135 kg). Testing shows the product can handle up to 744 lbs (337.5 kg) of instantaneous load, meeting a 2.5x safety factor. However, the pull up bar's capacity also depends on the usage environment. Users should strictly adhere to the 135 kg limit",
            "Over 250kg/550lb Capacity: This pull-up bar supports up to 550lb/250kg, ideal for larger users. Its durable design features a 2mm outer and 1.5mm inner steel pipe, ensuring long-lasting strength without deformation or breakage",
            "No Drilling, No Traces: Utilizing innovative fixative technology, this push-up bar installs without drilling. It features 2 enlarged 9\"x2\" PVC mats for added grip and a fall-proof design, ensuring stability as the load increases",
            "Double Safety Lock System: Equipped with a 360\u00b0 rotatable dual gear lock, Sportneer pull up bar for doorway prevents loosening during use. It\u2019s been rigorously tested for safety, allowing users to exercise with confidence in its sturdiness",
            "Easy-peasy Installation: Installation is simple with detailed instructions and a video guide. Just extend to your desired height and length. Ensure your wall or doorway is sturdy; avoid ceramic tiles or glass for best results",
            "Integrated, Extensible Structure: Unlike typical foam bars, this pull-up bar features an integrated, anti-slip cotton handle for a flexible grip. It adjusts from 30\" to 37.4\" (76cm to 95cm), perfect for various workouts like pull-ups and strength training"

        "description": "Become the best version of yourself! Develop great upper body strength including; your core, chest, shoulders, arms, and back. With this easy to install door frame bar - you get it all. Perform a variety of exercises and different types of pull-ups with the comfort grips from nearly any interior doorway (ranging from 24\" - 32\" wide). There are several grip options - standard grip overhand pull-ups, wide-grip pull-ups, neutral-grip pull-ups, or opposite grip (one overhand - the other underhand) pull-ups, there are plenty of ways to challenge yourself and mix things up in your pull-up routine all while strengthening your back, shoulders and arms. The challenge continues when you take your workout bar to the floor. Not only do you have multiple options with pull-ups, you also have a wide array of choices to select when doing floor exercises as well. Try mixing up your hand positions when doing push-ups with wide, narrow, and neutral grips. Each of these will develop different areas of your chest, shoulders, and arms. Turn your body over and grab the curved handles to perform some dips and work on the triceps. You can also add to the intensity by putting some weight onto your lap...but wait, there's more! Put the bar back in the door frame at the floor level and use it as a holder for your feet to get some hardcore core and ab work done. Mix in different variations of ab exercises to really get that hard earned six pack you've been looking for. Put the bar back up in the top of the door frame to get some hanging leg raises in. Turn yourself into the man you know you can be with the help of the pull-up and push-up workout bar!",
        "features": [
            "\u2605 MULTI-PURPOSE WORKOUT BAR: The variations of exercises to turn your upper body into a strong, well developed, muscular machine are wide ranging. From pull-ups to push-ups to dips to core with multiple grip options - allows you to work on becoming the envy of your neighborhood",
            "\u2605 SIMPLE ASSEMBLY & INSTALLS IN THE DOOR IN SECONDS: Easy instructions and hardware are included. Once you assemble the bar, simply put it in any standard interior doorway (from 24\"-32\" wide), use the leverage from the doorway to get to work on your body right away (holds up to 250 lbs)",
            "\u2605 FROM BEGINNER TO MASTER: Whether you are just starting out or can knock out 100 pull-ups in 30 minutes - use the bar to develop your skill no matter where you currently are on the spectrum. Beginners can use the ground, a chair, or a stool to assist them as they build strength to complete their first pull-up. For those who are more advanced, mix up hand positions and try different grips to keep things interesting",
            "\u2605 GET RESULTS BY CHANGING THINGS UP: For best results, don't exercise the same muscle groups everyday - mix things up. Stick to a routine for 3-4 weeks working on improving form and technique, then switch things up with different exercises for another 3-4 weeks. With the multiple grip options on the bar, there are plenty of variations to choose from so you can have a unique routine",
            "\u2605 WORKOUT ANYWHERE - ANYTIME: The pull-up/push-up bar is very versatile allowing you to take your workout with you - anywhere and anytime. Stuck at home? No problem - this bar is just over 20\" long, 8 inches wide, and 3.5\" tall making it easy to fit in nearly any interior doorway (24\" - 32\" wide). The floor space required for the floor exercises is very minimal as well. Wherever you can do a push up - you can do the rest of the exercises on the floor"

There are several grip options - standard grip overhand pull-ups, wide-grip pull-ups, neutral-grip pull-ups, or opposite grip (one overhand - the other underhand) pull-ups, there are plenty of ways to challenge yourself and mix things up in your pull-up routine all while strengthening your back, shoulders and arms. The challenge continues when you take your workout bar to the floor. Not only do you have multiple options with pull-ups, you also have a wide array of choices to select when doing floor exercises as well. Try mixing up your hand positions when doing push-ups with wide, narrow, and neutral grips. Each of these will develop different areas of your chest, shoulders, and arms. Turn your body over and grab the curved handles to perform some dips and work on the triceps. You can also add to the intensity by putting some weight onto your lap...but wait, there's more! Put the bar back in the door frame at the floor level and use it as a holder for your feet to get some hardcore core and ab work done. Mix in different variations of ab exercises to really get that hard earned six pack you've been looking for. Put the bar back up in the top of the door frame to get some hanging leg raises in. Turn yourself into the man you know you can be with the help of the pull-up and push-up workout bar!",

        "description": "The Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar is the only one that uses 1-1/4\" diameter steel tubing. This makes it the strongest one on the market. Don't be fooled by other I-Beam Pull Up Bars that claim to use 1-1/4\" steel tubing but ship 1.0\" steel tubing. We are proud to supply the United States Navy with our I-Beam Pull Up Bars (see product images). The United States Military has strict guidelines for strength and durability, which our product had no trouble meeting. The I-Beam Pull Up Bar is easy to install in 15 minutes or less, no drilling required. The unique design uses (6) bolts to clamp to the bottom flange of the I-Beam. Once installed it feels like the Pull Up Bar is welded to the I-Beam. It comes with foam rubber grips that give you 3 different pull up variations (wide, close, and pistol grip). These different variations isolate different muscles giving you a more complete workout. The Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar is engineered to last. It comes with a LIFETIME WARRANTY and is 100% made in the USA. If you have access to a steel I-beam you have to try the Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar. If you are not 100% satisfied with this product return it for a full refund, no questions asked. Please contact Firstlaw Fitness with any questions through Amazon or direct from our website.",

        "description": "The Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar is the only one that uses 1-1/4\" diameter steel tubing. This makes it the strongest one on the market. Don't be fooled by other I-Beam Pull Up Bars that claim to use 1-1/4\" steel tubing but ship 1.0\" steel tubing. We are proud to supply the United States Navy with our I-Beam Pull Up Bars (see product images). The United States Military has strict guidelines for strength and durability, which our product had no trouble meeting. The I-Beam Pull Up Bar is easy to install in 15 minutes or less, no drilling required. The unique design uses (6) bolts to clamp to the bottom flange of the I-Beam. Once installed it feels like the Pull Up Bar is welded to the I-Beam. It comes with foam rubber grips that give you 3 different pull up variations (wide, close, and pistol grip). These different variations isolate different muscles giving you a more complete workout. The Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar is engineered to last. It comes with a LIFETIME WARRANTY and is 100% made in the USA. If you have access to a steel I-beam you have to try the Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar. If you are not 100% satisfied with this product return it for a full refund, no questions asked. Please contact Firstlaw Fitness with any questions through Amazon or direct from our website.",

            "Easy Installation: Install quickly with detailed instructions, a video guide, and arrow markers on the chin-up bar. Spirit levels on both ends ensure correct setup. Ensure your doorway or wall is solid; avoid ceramic tiles, glass or non-solid doorframe. Note: Verify the marked rotation direction; reversing it may cause locking",
            "Integrated, Extensible Structure: Unlike most 2-section foam bars, this doorway pull up bar features an ultra long, integrated anti-slip cotton handlebar for a flexible grip. It's sweat-resistant, odorless, and durable. Twist the bar to adjust its length from 29.5 to 37 inches (75 to 94 cm) for various workouts like pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, stretching and more"

            "Before purchasing, please make sure that the size of your door frame is 29.5 in-37 in (75 cm-94 cm). This Chin up Bar is not suitable for door frame widths outside this range; The width of the door frame must be wider than the width of the anti-slip pads at both ends of the pull up bar",
            "To ensure safety, the manual specifies a maximum load of 297 lbs (135 kg). Testing shows the product can handle up to 744 lbs (337.5 kg) of instantaneous load, meeting a 2.5x safety factor. However, the pull up bar's capacity also depends on the usage environment. Users should strictly adhere to the 135 kg limit",
            "No Drilling, No Traces: The pull-up bar uses innovative fixative technology to stay in place. It features two large 6.5 x 1.8-inch PVC mats for added friction and stability. Four metal fixed points connect the base and bar, ensuring a secure, fall-proof design even under heavy loads",
            "Heavy Duty Construction: Our Pull Up Bar supports up to 440 lbs (200 kg) with its 2 mm outer and 1.5 mm inner steel pipes. This pull-up bar built to last without deforming or breaking, ensuring durability for your home gym. Note: Longer use distances may reduce the load of chin-up bar",
            "Upgraded Mechanic Lock System: This push-up bar features a new 360-degree rotatable dual gear lock on both ends to protect the bar from loosening. The doorway exercise bar has passed extensive testing, ensuring safety and sturdiness for confident use",
            "Easy Installation: Install quickly with detailed instructions, a video guide, and arrow markers on the chin-up bar. Spirit levels on both ends ensure correct setup. Ensure your doorway or wall is solid; avoid ceramic tiles, glass or non-solid doorframe. Note: Verify the marked rotation direction; reversing it may cause locking",
            "Integrated, Extensible Structure: Unlike most 2-section foam bars, this doorway pull up bar features an ultra long, integrated anti-slip cotton handlebar for a flexible grip. It's sweat-resistant, odorless, and durable. Twist the bar to adjust its length from 29.5 to 37 inches (75 to 94 cm) for various workouts like pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, stretching and more"

This helps to ensure safety and the chair will fly further, makes the kids more excited \nLikewise, widen the footprint of the KT Workout Stand as much as possible when hang punching bag or perform exercises that require safety such as swing body, kipping pull-ups... The wider the footprint, the firmer the frame. \nYou can do \"dead-hang\" without 02 distance-setting-bars (DSB) if you want a quick stretching for back pain relief. But, please mount the DSB for safety if you do other exercises such as aerial yoga, pull ups, swing body.. or you have severe spinal problems \nCurrently, Khanh Trinh Joint Stock Company (Brand KT KHANH TRINH) is holding the original design with materials and specifications are calculated carefully to ensure the best Quality.

Height adjustable \nExperience effortless customization with our user-friendly, adjustable-height KT training stand. Easily modify the height by hand from 72.8'' to 92.5'' (185cm - 235cm), without the need for any tools, making it a versatile addition to any room. This range includes numerous intermediate settings, ensuring a perfect fit for every pull-up user under 5.90 ft (180cm).

You can select the ideal height for pain-free back and spine stretching exercises. Say goodbye to bending your legs or jumping to reach the bar. Regular use of this stand for dead-hangs can bring about significant and noticeable improvements in your back health, day after day. \n3. Multipurpose \nBuilt for strength training and helping kids grow taller, its 92.5-inch (235cm) max height lets users under 6ft perform pull-ups without toes touching the ground. But why stop there? Unleash the full potential of this product by utilizing its robust load-bearing capacity. Attach aerial yoga hammock, exercise rings, TRX straps, or a punching bag for a diverse workout experience.

This versatility ensures your purchase stays valuable long after you\u2019ve stopped training, eliminating any worry of wasted money \n4. Stable \nFor pull-up enthusiasts, the robustness of our KT folding stand frame marks a significant advancement in home and office fitness equipment. We take immense pride in declaring that our product ranks among the most solid free-standing pull-up bars available in the market. \nWith an extensive background in pull-ups, Mr. Khanh Trinh has always prioritized sturdiness as a critical feature for a superior pull-up bar. His 15 years of experience and dedication have led to multiple design enhancements, effectively reducing wobble by 93%. While it may not be completely motionless, its remarkable stability has earned widespread praise from experienced users, including Mr. Khanh Trinh himself. More than just a fitness tool, it's an essential daily asset for serious fitness enthusiasts \n5. Strong and durable \nBoasting an innovative A-shaped structure with support bars integrated into each of its four legs, this stand is a testament to thoughtful design and material synergy. It's built to support users up to 220.5 lbs (100kgs) for everyday exercises, maintaining its prime condition without any signs of wear. \nCapable of withstanding up to 440.9 lbs (200kgs), our stand is resilient even under the most vigorous activities like kipping pull-ups. Its robust construction ensures it will never deform or collapse, no matter the intensity of your workout. The frame's integrity remains unaltered, preserving its original shape and offering unwavering safety to all users.

From selecting premium raw materials to ensuring the durability of load-bearing welds between pipes, every aspect of our product is fine-tuned for superior quality. Choose KT, where we prioritize quality over cost to deliver the best to our customers \nUsage notes \nLet's adjust the length of 02 distance-setting-bars to the maximum and mount to holes in the upper position to extend the KT frame's footprint when hanging the swing chair for kids. This helps to ensure safety and the chair will fly further, makes the kids more excited \nLikewise, widen the footprint of the KT Workout Stand as much as possible when hang punching bag or perform exercises that require safety such as swing body, kipping pull-ups... The wider the footprint, the firmer the frame. \nYou can do \"dead-hang\" without 02 distance-setting-bars (DSB) if you want a quick stretching for back pain relief. But, please mount the DSB for safety if you do other exercises such as aerial yoga, pull ups, swing body.. or you have severe spinal problems \nCurrently, Khanh Trinh Joint Stock Company (Brand KT KHANH TRINH) is holding the original design with materials and specifications are calculated carefully to ensure the best Quality. We have not yet authorized production and distribution for any other Brands/companies, so please be wary of counterfeit products from other Sellers \n\t\nKHANH TRINH Foldable Aerial Yoga Swing Stand Stable Pull Up Bar Indoor Outdoo... \nKT TOES DON'T TOUCH GROUND Foldable Free Standing Pull Up Bar Stand Sturdy Po... \nKT Dedicated Stand Frame For Aerial Yoga And Therapy Sensory Hammock Model KT... \nKT Toes Don't Touch Ground Super-Sturdy Foldable Adjustable Durable Free Stan... \nKT Rust-resistant Tall Pull Up Dip Station Squat Rack Foldable Power Tower St... \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.5 out of 5 stars \n651 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n583 \n\t\n4.4 out of 5 stars \n204 \n\t\n3.2 out of 5 stars \n8 \n\t\n1.0 out of 5 stars \n1 \n\t\nPrice $339.99$339.99 \t$345.50$345.50 \t$329.99$329.99 \t\u2014 \t$369.99$369.99 \t\n(Pull up bar exercise) Recommended for KT1.1518 is the model you're currently viewing.

Ensure your doorway or wall is solid; avoid ceramic tiles, glass or non-solid doorframe. Note: Verify the marked rotation direction",
            "\u3010ADJUSTABLE STRUCTURE\u3011The anti-slip EVA handles are sweat-proof, odorless and wear-resistant, offering unparalleled grip flexibility. With simple twist, you can effortlessly adjust the bar to any size between 28.7 inches and 39.4 inches, allowing you to customize it for your pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, stretching exercises, and beyond"

            "Before purchasing, ensure your door frame width is between 28.7-39.4 inches . This adjustable pull up bar is not suitable for frames outside this range. The door frame must be wider than the anti-slip pads at both ends of the bar",
            "\u3010SUPPORT FRAME DESIGN!\u3011This is an amazing new design, which greatly strengthens the load-bearing capacity of the horizontal bar, so that you can be more involved and more at ease when exercising! When mounted properly, this fitness bar can hold up to 881lbs(400kg), giving you full support for pull ups and chin ups",
            "\u3010NO DRILLING, NO SCREW\u3011 The CMJO Tie Rods feature an innovative fixing technology that eliminates the need to drill holes to hold the tie rod in place. It is supported by 2 enlarged 5.5\"x3\" PVC pads to ensure adequate friction for continued use.",
            "\u3010SAFETY UPGRADE - POP-UP PROTECTION\u3011The ends of this CMJO horizontal bar for home are triangular spring levers of our original design. When gravity presses down, the upper and lower springs automatically squeeze the wall. The heavier the load, the stronger it becomes.",
            "\u3010EASY INSTALLATION\u3011 Install quickly with detailed instructions, a video guide, and arrow markers on the chin-up bar. Spirit levels on both ends ensure correct setup. Ensure your doorway or wall is solid; avoid ceramic tiles, glass or non-solid doorframe. Note: Verify the marked rotation direction",
            "\u3010ADJUSTABLE STRUCTURE\u3011The anti-slip EVA handles are sweat-proof, odorless and wear-resistant, offering unparalleled grip flexibility. With simple twist, you can effortlessly adjust the bar to any size between 28.7 inches and 39.4 inches, allowing you to customize it for your pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, stretching exercises, and beyond"
