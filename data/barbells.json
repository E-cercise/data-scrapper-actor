Examples of barbell resistance training are squats, bench press, barbell row, shoulder press, deadlifts and curls to name a few.

        "description": "Synergee barbells are made with world renowned steel! These barbells are made with a high tensile strength of 190,000 PSI. Made with the perfect amount of \u201cwhip\u201d and \u201cflex\u201d for weightlifting, Synergee barbells still have the stiffness needed for heavy powerlifting, Olympic lifting, body building and crushing WODs. Each bar is tested for straightness and balance throughout the barbell. Comfort in your grip comes from the knurl. Our goal was to create a full and uniform pattern that is not too aggressive but still gives the maximum grip you need. The knurling on a barbell is ground onto the bar by a specialized machine. The pattern features two sets of diagonal lines, each set going in the opposite direction, so that they form thousands of tiny little diamonds. These diamonds keep your hands from slipping, ensuring your comfort throughout your workout. After testing multiple knurls, we settled on a standard knurl with dual knurl marks. The inner knurl mark is for powerlifting, while the outer is for Olympic weightlifting.",

        "description": "Synergee barbells are made with world renowned steel! These barbells are made with a high tensile strength of 190,000 PSI. Made with the perfect amount of \u201cwhip\u201d and \u201cflex\u201d for weightlifting, Synergee barbells still have the stiffness needed for heavy powerlifting, Olympic lifting, body building and crushing WODs. Each bar is tested for straightness and balance throughout the barbell. Comfort in your grip comes from the knurl. Our goal was to create a full and uniform pattern that is not too aggressive but still gives the maximum grip you need. The knurling on a barbell is ground onto the bar by a specialized machine. The pattern features two sets of diagonal lines, each set going in the opposite direction, so that they form thousands of tiny little diamonds. These diamonds keep your hands from slipping, ensuring your comfort throughout your workout. After testing multiple knurls, we settled on a standard knurl with dual knurl marks. The inner knurl mark is for powerlifting, while the outer is for Olympic weightlifting.",

            "Heavy-Duty Construction - The barbell is made from solid cold rolled steel with a black finish to protect the barbell bar from corrosion and stand the test of time. The 35 lb Olympic bar offers performance for powerlifting routines. Accommodates Olympic weight plates with a 2-inch center hole.",
            "500LB Capacity - Our Olympic lifting barbell can hold 500 lbs weight capacity with a 63,800 PSI tensile strength. Recommended for home-use free weight exercises. The loadable sleeve length is 15.3 inches, providing plenty of room to load your Olympic weights.",
            "Knurling - The knurled 30 mm handgrip diameter ensures a tight, non-slip grip when lifting. Medium depth knurling and center knurling for a secure grip. A Diamond Knurl pattern provides an excellent gripping surface without the sharpness of other grips, has a moderate whip, increases friction, and improves the grip experience.",
            "Rotating Sleeves - Bushings provide a comprehensive smooth spin which reduces stress on your wrists and elbows. Preventing the bar from warping and providing a more secure grip."

Will it peel or fade easily during use? \nDICAO dumbbells feature a top-notch coating, crafted to endure regular workouts. It's firmly bonded and won't peel or fade easily with proper use. Of course, avoid harsh chemicals and rough handling to keep it in prime condition. \nGive the floor area that the dumbbells take up so as to work out whether they'll fit in the storage space or not. \nIf the dumbbells are placed side by side, the floor area required by a pair of dumbbells is approximately equivalent to the usage area of a computer mainframe. Naturally, if there are dumbbell racks or storage boxes, the occupied size will vary. \nIs the dumbbell handle ergonomic? Will it be uncomfortable to hold for long? \nThe handle's curvature is designed according to the natural postures of the human hand when relaxed and grasping. It fits the palm curves well, relieving hand muscle and joint fatigue during use. \nWill the dumbbells damage my floor? \nAlthough the materials used for our dumbbell weight plates are unlikely to damage the floor, we still recommend that you place the dumbbells gently during use. This also helps extend the normal service life of the dumbbells.",

Will it peel or fade easily during use? \nDICAO dumbbells feature a top-notch coating, crafted to endure regular workouts. It's firmly bonded and won't peel or fade easily with proper use. Of course, avoid harsh chemicals and rough handling to keep it in prime condition. \nGive the floor area that the dumbbells take up so as to work out whether they'll fit in the storage space or not. \nIf the dumbbells are placed side by side, the floor area required by a pair of dumbbells is approximately equivalent to the usage area of a computer mainframe. Naturally, if there are dumbbell racks or storage boxes, the occupied size will vary. \nIs the dumbbell handle ergonomic? Will it be uncomfortable to hold for long? \nThe handle's curvature is designed according to the natural postures of the human hand when relaxed and grasping. It fits the palm curves well, relieving hand muscle and joint fatigue during use. \nWill the dumbbells damage my floor? \nAlthough the materials used for our dumbbell weight plates are unlikely to damage the floor, we still recommend that you place the dumbbells gently during use. This also helps extend the normal service life of the dumbbells.",

Made to fit weight plates with 2\" center holes, they are also known as Olympic weights. \nThe barbell is the simplest looking piece of equipment in the gym, but it\u2019s one of the most complex equipment to learn how to use. When a beginning trainer uses a barbell for the first time, the body\u2019s response is mainly mental. Learning how to move a barbell teaches our minds how to use all of our muscles together to move an object efficiently. Olympic barbell moves require balance and coordination, unlike machines, resulting in better performance during fitness competitions. \nWe suggest adding PAPABABE weight plates and power cage to get more fit! \nBlack Zinc and Diamond Knurling \nThe black part of the surface is treated with zinc plating, Diamond knurled handle design for easy controlled lifting to target desired muscle groups while reducing risk of injury. \nBearings, not Bushing \nUsing bearings for smooth sleeve rotation, designed to reduce pressure on wrists and forearms, and match the catching needs of the snatch and clean & jerk. \nCenter Knurl \nThe center knurl will help keep the bar in place on your back during back squats and on your chest for front squats. \nColor \tBlack \t\nWeight \t45 Pounds \t\nSleeve Length \t17.52 Inches \t\nTotal Length \t7 FT \t\nSleeve Diameter \t2 Inches \t\nShaft Diameter \t1.1 Inches \t\nBushing/Bearing \tBearing \t\nShaft Coating \tBlack zinc \t\nCapacity \t1200 Pounds \t\nSleeve Coating \tChrome \t\n\t\nAMGYM Bumper Plates 2 inch Bumpers Olympic Weight Plate with Steel Insert \nPAPABABE High bounce Olympic Weight Plates \nAMGYM Color Olympic Bumper Plate \npapababe Olympic Change Plates 2 inch Fractional Weight Plates \npapababe Squat Rack 800 LB Capacity Power Rack 2\"x 2\" Steel \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.6 out of 5 stars \n1,279 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n771 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n480 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n107 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n40 \n\t\nPrice $189.99$189.99 \t$149.99$149.99 \t$659.99$659.99 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\nDescription 160 lb set contain 2x10 lb, 2x25 lb and 2x45 lb.

Made to fit weight plates with 2\" center holes, they are also known as Olympic weights. \nThe barbell is the simplest looking piece of equipment in the gym, but it\u2019s one of the most complex equipment to learn how to use. When a beginning trainer uses a barbell for the first time, the body\u2019s response is mainly mental. Learning how to move a barbell teaches our minds how to use all of our muscles together to move an object efficiently. Olympic barbell moves require balance and coordination, unlike machines, resulting in better performance during fitness competitions. \nWe suggest adding PAPABABE weight plates and power cage to get more fit!",

Made to fit weight plates with 2\" center holes, they are also known as Olympic weights. \nThe barbell is the simplest looking piece of equipment in the gym, but it\u2019s one of the most complex equipment to learn how to use. When a beginning trainer uses a barbell for the first time, the body\u2019s response is mainly mental. Learning how to move a barbell teaches our minds how to use all of our muscles together to move an object efficiently. Olympic barbell moves require balance and coordination, unlike machines, resulting in better performance during fitness competitions. \nWe suggest adding PAPABABE weight plates and power cage to get more fit! \nBlack Zinc and Diamond Knurling \nThe black part of the surface is treated with zinc plating, Diamond knurled handle design for easy controlled lifting to target desired muscle groups while reducing risk of injury. \nBearings, not Bushing \nUsing bearings for smooth sleeve rotation, designed to reduce pressure on wrists and forearms, and match the catching needs of the snatch and clean & jerk. \nCenter Knurl \nThe center knurl will help keep the bar in place on your back during back squats and on your chest for front squats. \nColor \tBlack \t\nWeight \t45 Pounds \t\nSleeve Length \t17.52 Inches \t\nTotal Length \t7 FT \t\nSleeve Diameter \t2 Inches \t\nShaft Diameter \t1.1 Inches \t\nBushing/Bearing \tBearing \t\nShaft Coating \tBlack zinc \t\nCapacity \t1200 Pounds \t\nSleeve Coating \tChrome \t\n\t\nAMGYM Bumper Plates 2 inch Bumpers Olympic Weight Plate with Steel Insert \nPAPABABE High bounce Olympic Weight Plates \nAMGYM Color Olympic Bumper Plate \npapababe Olympic Change Plates 2 inch Fractional Weight Plates \npapababe Squat Rack 800 LB Capacity Power Rack 2\"x 2\" Steel \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.6 out of 5 stars \n1,279 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n771 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n480 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n107 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n40 \n\t\nPrice $189.99$189.99 \t$149.99$149.99 \t$659.99$659.99 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\nDescription 160 lb set contain 2x10 lb, 2x25 lb and 2x45 lb.

Made to fit weight plates with 2\" center holes, they are also known as Olympic weights. \nThe barbell is the simplest looking piece of equipment in the gym, but it\u2019s one of the most complex equipment to learn how to use. When a beginning trainer uses a barbell for the first time, the body\u2019s response is mainly mental. Learning how to move a barbell teaches our minds how to use all of our muscles together to move an object efficiently. Olympic barbell moves require balance and coordination, unlike machines, resulting in better performance during fitness competitions. \nWe suggest adding PAPABABE weight plates and power cage to get more fit!",

        "description": "Ensure your safety when you\u2019re lifting weights, whether it\u2019s explosive workouts, heavy powerlifting, or general strength training. A sliding weight or bumper plate can not only cause you to lose balance, but can be a serious safety hazard. Prevent injuries and stay focused on your perfect form by using ProsourceFit Olympic Spring Clip Collars. The sturdy chromed steel collars provide ample tension to secure plates on any standard 2-inch barbell. Smooth plastic handles make them easy to grip and slip on and off as you increase weight, ideal when your hands are sweaty from an intense training session! The simple design is easy to use and provides a secure fit every time. At only 7.8 oz per clip, you\u2019ll only add a miniscule amount to your bar, and they\u2019re compact enough you can keep a pair in your gym bag for those times when all of the other clips at the gym are being used. They\u2019re also ideal for home gyms. Get a few pairs so you don\u2019t have to switch them around as often \u2013 one set for the bench, and one for the squat rack. These are a necessary piece of equipment for serious athletes, ideal for squats, deadlifts, cleans, bench presses, snatches, and more.

        "description": "Ensure your safety when you\u2019re lifting weights, whether it\u2019s explosive workouts, heavy powerlifting, or general strength training.

Prevent injuries and stay focused on your perfect form by using ProsourceFit Olympic Spring Clip Collars.

The simple design is easy to use and provides a secure fit every time. At only 7.8 oz per clip, you\u2019ll only add a miniscule amount to your bar, and they\u2019re compact enough you can keep a pair in your gym bag for those times when all of the other clips at the gym are being used.

        "description": "Everyday Essentials Solid 2-Inch Olympic Super Curl Bar Barbell Weight Lifting Bar, 350-Pound Capacity, 48-Inch Overview: Barbell exercises are a form of resistance training. Resistance training is using your muscles to move resistance, usually weights. Examples of barbell resistance training are squats, bench press, barbell row, shoulder press, deadlifts and curls to name a few. Barbells allow you to move more weight than you could with a dumbbell because you have two hands on a fixed object. This makes it safer to learn new exercises. Dimensions: Chrome, 48-inch, 2\" bar end diameter, chrome plated, bar weight: 25 pounds; Weight capacity: 350-Pound.
