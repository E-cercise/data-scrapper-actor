            "BYE, BYE BATTLE ROPE \u2013 A new fluid battle rope alternative has hit the market. The Inertia Wave delivers a unique, trademark blend of metabolic conditioning (MetCon), High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), and aerobic activity. The Inertia Wave is Gronk Approved! Like many professional athletes, Rob Gronkowski trains with the inertia wave. Because of the benefits he received, his family\u2019s fitness company decided to create a Gronk Branded version",
            "NOT YOUR TYPICAL BATTLE ROPE - Weighing in at under 2.7 pounds, its lightweight design ensures portability and convenient storage. Compared to the heavy, bulky ropes that will clutter your workout space, you can now say goodbye to fraying, unwinding, or tearing ropes. The Inertia Wave is a must have exercise equipment that is built to last",
            "CALORIE CRUSHER & FAT BURNER - Unlike most battle ropes, experience the fluidity of smooth and coordinated movements while reinforcing core strength. Achieve a higher caloric burn and an Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC) effect that surpasses traditional battle ropes, as demonstrated by the SCSU-MIT study. Rest assured, the 7 approved methods of use guarantee 100% safety during practice. Users report remarkable cognitive enhancements, improved timing and hand-eye coordination",
            "EASY TO LEARN & TAKE ANYWHERE - There are hundreds of free videos to learn the Inertia Wave techniques that can help any beginner become a pro. Inertia Wave comes with its own versatile anchor kit so that you can work out anywhere, anytime and attach it anywhere you go.

            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a fullbody workout with a focus on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, to build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: Titan Fitness has a full selection of ropes ranging for intermediate users to advanced. If you are just starting out, we highly recommend the 30foot ropes with either 1.5 or 2in diameters.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The threestrandthick exercise rope features a durable poly Dacron blend with the strength to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavyduty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, longlasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 30 feet with a 1.5in diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a full-body workout with a focus on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, to build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: Titan Fitness has a full selection of ropes ranging for intermediate users to advanced. If you are just starting out, we highly recommend the 30-foot ropes with either 1.5 or 2-inch diameters.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable poly Dacron blend with strength to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 50 feet with a 1.5-inch diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a full-body workout with a focus on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, to build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: Titan Fitness has a full selection of ropes ranging for intermediate users to advanced. If you are just starting out, we highly recommend the 30-foot ropes with either 1.5 or 2-inch diameters.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable poly Dacron blend with strength to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 50 feet with a 1.5-inch diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

Super Soft and Tear Resistant that you don't worry frayed. \nLOWER STATIC ELONGATION: Static elongation measures how much a rope stretches with a 176 lb weight tied to one end. A good percentage is right around 7 percent. Higher static elongation generally indicates less efficiency because energy is wasted through rope stretch. \nThe rope was composed of a rope skin and an inner core, and both were made of nylon fiber. \nWhen the inner core of a rope is made, the machine synchronously wraps it in a rope to form a finished rope. \nAlthough the inner core is not visible, the quality of the entire rope can be judged by carefully observing the skin of the rope. \nThe thickness of the skin and the number of turns around the rope determine the wear resistance and durability of the rope. \nMore Application: Tie, Pull, Swing, Climb and Knot. Winches, Dock rigging, Blocking, Flagpole lanyards, Tent guide lines, Clothes lines, Craft/general purpose Tie Down, Boat dock and Mooring lines, Horse halters and reins, Dog Leashes, Art and decorative, Scout knot tying construction, Awning Tie Downs, Ropes Course Construction, Anchor lines, Hammock, Swings, Deck/Dock railings, Golf courses, Crowd control, Water and Snow Ski Ropes, Pool safety & decoration Rope, Decorative Knot Work, Guy Rope, Pet toys, Extremely Long Lasting Synthetic Cabling, Truck cargo Tie down, Electrical Underground Pulling Line, Guy Lines pulling, Halyards, Slings , Knot Tying Classes, Equine Use, Exercise Rope (battle rope, undulation), or simple household applications. \nProfessional production, High Quality! \nX XBEN is mainly engaged in the outdoor field, we focus on designing and manufacturing high-quality products.

Super Soft and Tear Resistant that you don't worry frayed. \nLOWER STATIC ELONGATION: Static elongation measures how much a rope stretches with a 176 lb weight tied to one end. A good percentage is right around 7 percent. Higher static elongation generally indicates less efficiency because energy is wasted through rope stretch. \nThe rope was composed of a rope skin and an inner core, and both were made of nylon fiber. \nWhen the inner core of a rope is made, the machine synchronously wraps it in a rope to form a finished rope. \nAlthough the inner core is not visible, the quality of the entire rope can be judged by carefully observing the skin of the rope. \nThe thickness of the skin and the number of turns around the rope determine the wear resistance and durability of the rope. \nMore Application: Tie, Pull, Swing, Climb and Knot.

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a full-body workout with a focus on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, to build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: Titan Fitness has a full selection of ropes ranging for intermediate users to advanced. If you are just starting out, we highly recommend the 30-foot ropes with either 1.5 or 2-in diameters.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable poly Dacron blend with strength to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 40 feet with a 2-in diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a full-body workout with a focus on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, to build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: Titan Fitness has a full selection of ropes ranging for intermediate users to advanced. If you are just starting out, we highly recommend the 30-foot ropes with either 1.5 or 2-in diameters.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable poly Dacron blend with strength to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 40 feet with a 2-in diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

            "The ultimate strength and conditioning tools! Battle rope are often thought of as a tool for your upper body, which they are. However, their benefits don't end there. It workouts work the muscles in your abs, back, and glutes, and you can incorporate movements, such as jumps, lunges, and squats, that work your legs.",
            "Durable - Super Deal UPGRADED three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable polyester blend with high tensile strength to prevent breakage. It can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout. Plus, the black color makes dirt less visible and keeps your rope looking new longer.",
            "Portable - The rope\u2019s flexible design makes it easy to roll up and take almost anywhere\u2014from home to the gym, park, or beach and back again. All that\u2019s needed is a stable anchor, like a tree or a pole, and it\u2019s ready to go. It can also be rolled up and stored out of the way when not in use.",
            "Versatile - We have the full size on the market for you to choose from. With 3 different lengths and 2 thicknesses, we've got you covered.

            "WARRANTY: If your rope breaks during normal use as a battle rope, we'll replace it. Grab one today and ride the waves right now!"

            "The ultimate strength and conditioning tools! Battle rope are often thought of as a tool for your upper body, which they are. However, their benefits don't end there. It workouts work the muscles in your abs, back, and glutes, and you can incorporate movements, such as jumps, lunges, and squats, that work your legs.",
            "Durable - Super Deal UPGRADED three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable polyester blend with high tensile strength to prevent breakage. It can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout. Plus, the black color makes dirt less visible and keeps your rope looking new longer.",
            "Portable - The rope\u2019s flexible design makes it easy to roll up and take almost anywhere\u2014from home to the gym, park, or beach and back again. All that\u2019s needed is a stable anchor, like a tree or a pole, and it\u2019s ready to go. It can also be rolled up and stored out of the way when not in use.",
            "Versatile - We have the full size on the market for you to choose from. With 3 different lengths and 2 thicknesses, we've got you covered.

            "WARRANTY: If your rope breaks during normal use as a battle rope, we'll replace it. Grab one today and ride the waves right now!"

We then sheathed the rope in a durable, protective nylon sheath/cover, adding an additional wear-resistant layer to an already heavy-duty conditioning tool. To cap the ends of the rope, we used a thick heat shrink material, creating deep finger grooves for enhanced grip and a natural hand position. \nPair your battle rope with our XSteel Battle Rope Wall Mount Kit for everything you need to get set up and start training (sold separately).",

Wrist straps let users hold longer for maximum muscle fatigue. Grab the oversized grips to challenge your grip wrist, and forearm strength.",
            "TAKE IT ANYWHERE- at 30ft long, it is perfect for boot camps, CrossFit trainers, gyms, home workouts, and strength training! Get a great workout no matter what type of athlete you are. Easily bend and pack in your bag and take your workout anywhere.",
            "PERFECT WORKOUT: Get up to 60 Ibs of resistance, the battle rope not only improves your cardio but will provide a full body workout with a focus on improving muscle endurance and strength.

            "QUALITY: Designed to withstand rigorous use, the cover will help deter dirt and prevent the rope from fraying. Nylon sleeves cover protects the rope from friction and allows users to use the rope outdoors."

You can attach the elastic rope to a hip-belt or harness and start running and jumping with it. Or you can attach it to the bar and start doing push and pull exercises. Wrist straps let users hold longer for maximum muscle fatigue. Grab the oversized grips to challenge your grip wrist, and forearm strength.",
            "TAKE IT ANYWHERE- at 30ft long, it is perfect for boot camps, CrossFit trainers, gyms, home workouts, and strength training! Get a great workout no matter what type of athlete you are. Easily bend and pack in your bag and take your workout anywhere.",
            "PERFECT WORKOUT: Get up to 60 Ibs of resistance, the battle rope not only improves your cardio but will provide a full body workout with a focus on improving muscle endurance and strength.

            "QUALITY: Designed to withstand rigorous use, the cover will help deter dirt and prevent the rope from fraying. Nylon sleeves cover protects the rope from friction and allows users to use the rope outdoors."

            "rawText": "From the manufacturer\nIncrease your overall health & fitness with our Elite Series Strength Training Power Cages & Squat Racks for Home Gym | Be HulkFit! \nThe problem with living a sedentary lifestyle and our solution | The benefits of a healthy lifestyle \nYour body and mind don't work at full capacity when you don't keep them occupied with a quality exercise routine. A quality workout not only makes your body stronger, but it makes your mind more resilient, builds your confidence, and improves your mental health. \nThe Elite Series Power Cage/Squat Rack is a functional piece of exercise equipment that is designed to give you a safe environment to exercise in and it will be a perfect addition to your home gym, garage gym, or light commercial setting. The multi-functional power rack will give you variety to your workout routine. You can complete multiple types of training that include: \nStrength training (Weightlifting tools include - barbell, weight plates, and dumbbells; helps with functional strength)\nBodyweight training\nResistance training (Exercise bands and straps; used to warm-up and recover from lifting weights)\nCircuit training (Example - 3 - 5 exercises performed in rotation; great for martial arts and other combat sports)\nStation to station (3 - 5 sets of repetitions per exercise)\nThis power cage allows you to perform exercises to help increase muscularity and overall fitness of your entire body, what we like to call your \"Core 4\", which includes: \nArms (Example - bench press)\nLegs (Example - squats)\nBack (Example - rows)\nCore (Example - knee raises)\nHow we differ from the competition... \nMany competitors have released strength training power cages for home gym set ups with a less stable and weaker gauge steel. A frame that features 2\u201d x 2\u201d or 2.5\" x 2.5\" upright poles and ineffective brackets to connect the frame. We responded by adding soldered brackets to increase joint strength with larger upright poles (3\" x 3\") and thicker gauge steel. Thus, creating a more stable frame. We also included more accessories and attachments. The Elite Series Power Cage package includes: \n(1) Power Cage/Squat Rack\n(1) Pull Up Bar\n(2) Spotter Arms with J Hooks\n(2) Weight Plate Holders\n(2) J Hooks\n(8) Resistance Band Bars\nSafety bars are absolutely necessary when weightlifting without a spotter. These wider, padded safety bars inherently provide more protection because of its ability to redistribute shock evenly. \nPossibilities are endless with just a little bit of creativity! \nYou can add larger strength training attachments like the Jammer Arms and Lat Pulldown machine, which we specifically designed to attach to the Elite Series Power Cage. Both of these attachments will give you many more creative exercises to perform. Other accessories or attachments you can add onto the squat rack include: Battle Rope Anchor, Vertical Barbell Storage, Horizontal Barbell Storage, J Hooks (pair), and Weight Plate Holder. \nProduct weighs 302 lb. Total weight capacity is 1200 lbs. \nDon't forget about HulkFit Barbells, Weight Plates, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Barbell and Weight Storage Racks! \n\t\nHulkfit Elite Lat Pull Down \nHulkfit Elite Jammer Arms \nHulkfit Elite J-hooks (Pair) \nHulkfit Elite Battle Rope Anchor \nHulkfit Elite Weight Plate Holder (Single) \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.0 out of 5 stars \n103 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n103 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n103 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n103 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n103 \n\t\nPrice $215.92$215.92 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t$23.04$23.04 \t$22.43$22.43 \t\nWeight Capacity 300lbs \t440lbs \t500lbs \tN/A \t200lbs",

A quality workout not only makes your body stronger, but it makes your mind more resilient, builds your confidence, and improves your mental health. \nThe Elite Series Power Cage/Squat Rack is a functional piece of exercise equipment that is designed to give you a safe environment to exercise in and it will be a perfect addition to your home gym, garage gym, or light commercial setting. The multi-functional power rack will give you variety to your workout routine. You can complete multiple types of training that include: \nStrength training (Weightlifting tools include - barbell, weight plates, and dumbbells; helps with functional strength)\nBodyweight training\nResistance training (Exercise bands and straps; used to warm-up and recover from lifting weights)\nCircuit training (Example - 3 - 5 exercises performed in rotation; great for martial arts and other combat sports)\nStation to station (3 - 5 sets of repetitions per exercise)\nThis power cage allows you to perform exercises to help increase muscularity and overall fitness of your entire body, what we like to call your \"Core 4\", which includes: \nArms (Example - bench press)\nLegs (Example - squats)\nBack (Example - rows)\nCore (Example - knee raises)\nHow we differ from the competition... \nMany competitors have released strength training power cages for home gym set ups with a less stable and weaker gauge steel. A frame that features 2\u201d x 2\u201d or 2.5\" x 2.5\" upright poles and ineffective brackets to connect the frame. We responded by adding soldered brackets to increase joint strength with larger upright poles (3\" x 3\") and thicker gauge steel. Thus, creating a more stable frame. We also included more accessories and attachments. The Elite Series Power Cage package includes: \n(1) Power Cage/Squat Rack\n(1) Pull Up Bar\n(2) Spotter Arms with J Hooks\n(2) Weight Plate Holders\n(2) J Hooks\n(8) Resistance Band Bars\nSafety bars are absolutely necessary when weightlifting without a spotter. These wider, padded safety bars inherently provide more protection because of its ability to redistribute shock evenly. \nPossibilities are endless with just a little bit of creativity! \nYou can add larger strength training attachments like the Jammer Arms and Lat Pulldown machine, which we specifically designed to attach to the Elite Series Power Cage. Both of these attachments will give you many more creative exercises to perform. Other accessories or attachments you can add onto the squat rack include: Battle Rope Anchor, Vertical Barbell Storage, Horizontal Barbell Storage, J Hooks (pair), and Weight Plate Holder. \nProduct weighs 302 lb. Total weight capacity is 1200 lbs. \nDon't forget about HulkFit Barbells, Weight Plates, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Barbell and Weight Storage Racks!"

            "HOW TO USE: Fold your rope in half at an anchor point. Have enough space in the room for half your rope length. The longer the length, the more versatile. A wider rope makes for a more challenging grip",
            "DURABLE MATERIALS: Battle tested, wear resistant materials made from Poly Dacron, able to withstand intense workouts for years to come. Rubber handles for an enhanced grip and hand protection"

            "BUILD YOUR FORM: Battle ropes are a great conditioning tool for a full-body workout with a focus on increasing muscular endurance and cardiovascular conditioning. The battle ropes are built for athletes to train for increased power, to build core strength, and improve explosiveness.",
            "PAIR WITH ANCHOR STRAP KIT FOR BATTLE ROPE: Secure your battle ropes to any stationary anchor as the battle ropes move freely when they are attached to the straps, allowing you to have a more natural range of motion. Use these straps to reduce the intensity of your work out by shortening the ropes; increase the intensity by extending them back out or adding multiple ropes for maximum resistance.",
            "FULL SELECTION OF ROPE SIZES: Titan Fitness has a full selection of ropes ranging for intermediate users to advanced. If you are just starting out, we highly recommend the 40 foot ropes with either 1.5 or 2-in diameters.",
            "DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: The three-strand-thick exercise rope features a durable poly Dacron blend with strength to prevent breakage and fraying. The heavy-duty exercise rope can be used indoors or out, and it offers reliable, long-lasting performance, so you can keep the focus on your workout.",
            "DIMENSIONS: Titan Battle rope measures at 40 feet with a 1.5-in diameter. The handles have an extra coating to prevent the rope from fraying. Which will greatly increase the life of the battle rope and allow it to be used outdoors."

With the Vulken triceps strap, you can handle it all with just one rope.

            "One Triceps Rope for Diversified Exercises: No need to switch between multiple triceps ropes of different sizes for various exercises anymore. With the Vulken triceps strap, you can handle it all with just one rope. Its two-lengths-in-one design provides great versatility to your workout routine by allowing you to easily switch lengths between different rope exercises such as face pulls, triceps pushdowns, bicep curls, and more cable attachment exercises.",
            "Increase Range of Motion: Traditional triceps ropes are too short and limit your ability to open up the shoulders fully for exercises like the face pull. Vulken Dual length triceps straps with its 37 inches length allows you to extend your range of motion to the max.",
            "Isolating Your Target Muscles: When using traditional ropes with caps, your wrists might be tired out before your intended back and shoulders muscles are fully worked. Vulken triceps straps allow you to use a proper workout weight to build your target muscles groups without wrist strain, to tone your upper body effectively.",
            "Ideal Ergonomics Prevents Joint Injuries: The triceps straps provide 4 gripping options allowing placement of hands in the most comfortable position, taking excessive stress off your wrists, fingers, and elbows."

            "Sizing - 9ft rope weighs 1.2lbs and is recommended for heights 5'9\" to 6'1\" tall. A thick 12mm diameter PVC cord creates extra drag for a quicker cardio rope workout and forearm/shoulder burn.",
            "Grip Strength - Jumping rope for workout with this style of heavy jump rope is used by Muay Thai fighters to build grip strength and muscle endurance for grappling. Designed to engage the core, back, shoulder and arms that don't normally get a workout.",
            "Smooth Spin - Most weighted exercise ropes are clunky and difficult to spin. The Elite Jumps Muay Thai's dual ball bearing design makes for a fast smooth spin, making it easy for beginners to develop rhythm and fast enough for double unders.",
            "Heavy Duty Workout Jump Ropes - This weighted rope was designed to last and take the abuse of the gym and endurance workouts. Upgraded 12mm PVC cord can be used on outdoor and rough surfaces. Industrial grade 4.7\" long handles are made of an ultra durable unbreakable plastic.",
            "Suitable for Anyone - At 1.2lbs this rope is the perfect weighted jump rope for women or men. The resistance is created by the \"drag\" of the rope through the air; greater resistance is created by spinning the rope quickly making these the perfect weighted ropes for working out."

            "Grip Strength - Jumping rope for workout with this style of heavy jump rope is used by Muay Thai fighters to build grip strength and muscle endurance for grappling. Designed to engage the core, back, shoulder and arms that don't normally get a workout.",
            "Smooth Spin - Most weighted exercise ropes are clunky and difficult to spin. The Elite Jumps Muay Thai's dual ball bearing design makes for a fast smooth spin, making it easy for beginners to develop rhythm and fast enough for double unders.",
            "Heavy Duty Workout Jump Ropes - This weighted rope was designed to last and take the abuse of the gym and endurance workouts. Upgraded 12mm PVC cord can be used on outdoor and rough surfaces. Industrial grade 4.7\" long handles are made of an ultra durable unbreakable plastic.",
            "Suitable for Anyone - At 1.2lbs this rope is the perfect weighted jump rope for women or men. The resistance is created by the \"drag\" of the rope through the air; greater resistance is created by spinning the rope quickly making these the perfect weighted ropes for working out."

            "Smooth Spin - Most weighted exercise ropes are clunky and difficult to spin. The Elite Jumps Muay Thai's dual ball bearing design makes for a fast smooth spin, making it easy for beginners to develop rhythm and fast enough for double unders.",
            "Heavy Duty Workout Jump Ropes - This weighted rope was designed to last and take the abuse of the gym and endurance workouts. Upgraded 12mm PVC cord can be used on outdoor and rough surfaces. Industrial grade 4.7\" long handles are made of an ultra durable unbreakable plastic.",
            "Suitable for Anyone - At 1.2lbs this rope is the perfect weighted jump rope for women or men. The resistance is created by the \"drag\" of the rope through the air; greater resistance is created by spinning the rope quickly making these the perfect weighted ropes for working out."
