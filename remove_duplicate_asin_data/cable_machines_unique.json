            "rawText": "Product Description\nVopit Lat Pull Down Bar Set \nThis kit is mainly aimed at training back muscles, compared with normal pull bars, it is more Ergonomic designed and Systematic training.\nErgonomic grip handles ensure that force line fits with the orientation of wrist at Neutral position, so you could pull down larger pounds comfortably, at the same time protect your wrists.\nThe 3 pulldown bars are V-shaped designed, you could pull down further when doing lat pulldown, and give more stimulation to your back muscles.\nThe 2 small rowing bars has different grip shapes, with the help of soft dipping surface, more convenient to find the feeling of force.\nThis machine attachment kit could train most upper body muscles, especially back. Trained muscles are as follows: Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Teres Major, Teres Minor, Infraspinatus, Biceps, Triceps.\nSuitable Training Plan: Seated row exercises, LAT pull down, knee bending pull down, Bent over row, T-bar bent over row, Cable close grip pulldown, Choppers.\nOn the basis of ensuring the structural strength, the weight of each bar is 6 ~ 7 lbs (except the longest bar), which is portable for home gym or outdoor workout.\nMost importantly, our pull-down handle set is heavy-duty, with a total net weight of 15.8kg (34.7 pounds), which allows it to withstand greater loads.\nPowerful Strength Training Gear \nStainless Steel Hanging Hole \nIntegrated stainless steel hanging hole, wear resistant, protecting the inner steel body to get a long service life. \nThis hole diameter is 1/2 inch, which fits most carabiners; And the position is closer to the edge, which is convenient for carabiners. \nHeavy Duty Bars \nThe inner body is made of high-strength steell( Enhanced thickness of 10 mm), solid structure, and the whole thickness is up to 15.6 mm. \nDipped Surface \nThe Surface is dipping treatment with PVC rubber, providing protection for steel body, at the same time increases the friction, avoid palm sliding while training. \nV-shaped Design \nCompared with normal straight pulldown bar, it could provides a wider range of motion when doing pull back work out, stimulating muscles more fully. \nNarrow Grips \nNarrow grips are mainly used on rowing machine, of course you could also choose other training plan freely as your need while working out.\nYou can flipthe handle orientation as needed to get a more comfortable feel or get better pump.\nWide Grips & Mid Grips \nWide grip is mainly aimed at strengthening the width of the back contour. It stimulates the lateral latissimus dorsi, trapezius and teres major muscles.\nThe mid-pitch grips are mainly aimed at the inner part of the latissimus dorsi and the trapezius muscle. It can strengthen the thickness of the back contour.\nReinforced Packaging \nIn order to better protect these grips, we use high High strength corrugated box, Polyethylene foam cushioning sponge lining for packaging, which Greatly reduces the damage to products and packaging boxes caused by external pressure.\nThe integrated sponge lining Enhances pressure resistance, and ensures that the grip bars will not move in box to avoid collision with each other during transportation.\nThe mag bars are heavy-duty, total net weight of 34.7 lbs, heavier than others at least of 3 Lbs, more durable for long-term excercise.\nExtra Added Carbineers \nTo make it easier to use these mag bars and to reduce wear and tear on the surface, we've added 5 carabiners.\nThese carabiners are stainless steel and have a high weight capacity, and you can choose to leave these carabiners on the handle holes for easy access next time.\nTips \nBecause everyone's exercise status and training style are different, generally, high pull-down is more helpful to increase back width. However, some people prefer to using rowing machine or sitting posture rowing.\nYou don't have to be limited to a fixed grip method. You can also try the logo side down gripping to train.

            "High Efficient Stripping: The VEVOR wire stripping machine adopts a 60 W gear motor, which is powerful as the strong 180 W motor but compact. The gearbox leads to fast stripping speed, plus the hands-free design increases security and convenience. Widely used in cable/wire manufacturers, recycling plants, and copper products factories.",
            "See and Focus: Looking for a wire peeler machine that will stand the test of time? Look no further than this baby! With a sturdy cast iron body and a clear acrylic panel, you'll be able to see exactly what's going on during the stripping process. Plus, its non-deformed structure means it'll keep going strong for years to come. Say goodbye to frustrating wire stripping experiences and hello to convenience and reliability!",
            "Wide Compatibility: The VEVOR wire stripper machine has 7 stripping holes, including 6 round channels and 1 flat slot. Adjust the blade to fit all wires with a diameter from 0.06'' (1.5 mm) to 0.98'' (25 mm). Suitable for handling hard cover wires, soft cover wires, multi-conductor wires, mono-filament wires, etc.",
            "Upgraded Stripping Structure: The electric wire stripper machine is added with hole-size markings. Different size wires can be stripped precisely without repeated adjustments, making it easier and quicker to strip the wires. Also, the blade is made of 65 mn spring steel for ultra strength and hardness, extending the life of the blades.",
            "Complete Accessories: We want you to feel confident while using our copper stripper, which is why we've included a pair of gloves to protect your hands from dirt and injury. But that's not all! We've also supplemented the instructions with tips on the perfect stripping angle, so even if it's your first time, you can jump right in and start stripping copper like a pro!

        "features": [
            "[Independent Dual Pulley System] Unlike the common power cage, the HR05 has an independent 1:1 ratio double pulley system on both sides of the frame. 1:1 means that the weight you train is the weight you load. And the weight capacity of power rack will double. The independent pulley system allows you to complete super set, drop set, co-training and other gym workouts without being limited by the home gym weight stack cap.",
            "[4-IN-1 Home Gym Partner] HR05 combines a power rack, multi-grip pull up bar, cable crossover machine and 360\u00b0 landmine into one machine. At the same time, the pulley system has been upgraded to give you a seamless and stable movement experience. The improved sliding sleeve ensures smooth operation while protecting the pulley from damage. Gross Weight: 205 lbs. The machine boasts a maximum capacity of up to 2000 lbs.",
            "[Unique Column] More holes have been drilled into the HR05 power cage's posts at 1-inch spacing, giving you a total of 30 height options. There are also digital markers on the side to help you locate quickly. In addition, we use the standard 2\"x 2\" column, which can be adapted to a variety of accessories on the market to unlock more training possibilities. The tube thickness of 2 mm effectively ensures the stability of the power rack.",
            "[Space-saving Design] Another major feature of the HR05 is the space savings, the frame design is closer to half rack, compared to most power racks, its space can be reduced by nearly two-thirds. In addition, we are equipped with more weight storage areas in the middle of HR05, which can not only effectively organize the space of the home gym, but also increase the stability of the shelves.",
            "[Fully equipped & versatile] The HR05 power cage comes with all the attachments you may need more of in your daily training. including 4 free handle attachments, 2 safety spotter pins, dip bars, j hooks, and T-bar row attachment. This provides a wide range of exercises, such as wide & narrow lat pull-downs, T-bar rows, seated cable rows, bench presses, squats, deadlifts, bicep curls, triceps extensions, pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, and more."

        "features": [
            "[Compact for Limited Space] The LP10 leg press and hack squat machine, with dimensions of 67 inches (L) x 52 inches (W) x 47 inches (H) and a footprint of only 24.2 sq. m., offers efficient space utilization. Compared to other large combo machines, this machine can save almost 1/3 of the space. The installation manual and video guide you through the assembly quickly. The LP10 is ideal for limited spaces such as a garage or home gym.",
            "[Unique 30\u00b0Combo Machine] Unlike the common 45\u00b0leg press hack squat combo machine on the market, we offer a unique 30\u00b0positive angle. The relaxed 30\u00b0position enables better isolation of the quadriceps, and it\u2019s friendly for individuals with insufficient lower back strength and knee joint issues. Compared to traditional squat racks and barbells, it\u2019s generally considered safer and more user-friendly.",
            "[Pocket-Friendly] Save your wallet without compromising the effectiveness of your leg workout.",
            "[Full Range of Motion] Another great feature of the LP10 leg press hack squat combo machine is its full range of motion, which allows you to achieve deeper depth in your squats, even allowing for an ATG squat. Most 45\u00b0combo machines have a seat pad installed under the guide rail for users to get support while doing leg press, but this overall squat range is limited. In comparison, the LP10 is definitely a wise choice.",
            "[Easy Adjustable, Easy Organize] The backboard and foot pedals can be adjusted in 7 angles respectively to target different muscle groups. The shoulder pad used for assisting hack squats is removable and has 3 adjustable positions to accommodate people of different heights. We also added a storage area at the back of the product to keep your weight plates organized. The band pegs allow you to use resistance bands for resistance training.",
            "[Stable Construction] The LP10 has excellent stability and smooth performance. The steel tubes of the rails are 3mm thick and very robust. With a maximum weight capacity of 1000 lbs, it's solid and reliable. Our unique stop-loss device, featuring 1 solid stopper and 5 adjustable hole positions, ensures 100% injury prevention. Each stopper can handle a weight of up to 500 lbs."
