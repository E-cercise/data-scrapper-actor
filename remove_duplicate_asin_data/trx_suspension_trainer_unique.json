            "Plan Workout Like a Pro - Perhaps it's the easy to see instructions that makes Grand Basics gym posters the most popular for home fitness and small gyms. Maybe it's the 460+ home exercise options, or even the eye-catching design that\u2019s cleaner than other workout posters. Regardless, just be careful when you stick Grand Basics on your wall, because you might just get in shape faster than you thought!",
            "460+ Exercise Ideas - While we don\u2019t show you how to create a workout, we give you enough exercises in your workout poster set to last forever! In fact, if you choose 5 random exercises every day, you\u2019d have workouts to last for 50 Billion Years (we did the math). Easy to understand for Beginners, but also easy to glance for pros and PT\u2019s to plan out a personal training session or create it on the fly.",
            "Set of 12, Single-Sided, 17\" x 27\" Posters - Barbell Exercise Poster, Bodyweight Exercise Poster, Dumbbells Poster, Stability Ball Workout Poster, Kettlebell Workout Chart, Medicine Ball Poster, Tension Bands Exercise, Stretching Poster, Suspension Training, Yoga Poster, Foam Roller Exercise Wall Poster plus Muscle Group Gym Poster.

            "Smooth, Eye-Catching Surface - We use 200gsm, 1.5MIL Laminated Paper for your home gym posters. And unlike thick laminated fitness posters, ours are easier to roll up, and easier to flatten so they sit nice and flat on your wall (use 3M adhesive strips). But more importantly, The Color-Block Titles and Color-Coded Design looks clean and tidy in your home gym decor so it\u2019s easier to find what you need.",
            "As Seen in Yoga Journal - If you\u2019re looking for one of the top poster sets according to the number one source for in-depth yoga pose instruction, (and our existing customers), why not try this set now for 30-Days. They\u2019ll arrive pre-rolled, with instructions on how to easily flatten them. And, if you\u2019re not happy you can return for a refund. So, let\u2019s go! Make your home workouts count with Grand Basics."

The gap between the door and the door frame should be greater than 1/8\", which is about the thickness of 3 credit cards stacked together. The door anchor can be installed on the top, bottom and sides of the door.",

Its design makes it easy to use and even easier to store. \nA versatile suspension trainer \nPrevious page\nFast, Fun, and Easy \nTrain from anywhere \nEasy to adjust \nIncludes door anchor \nErgonomic Grip \nBring the gym to your home \nNext page\nUnlock your full potential in every workout \nThe video showcases the product in use.The video guides you through product setup.The video compares multiple products.The video shows the product being unpacked.\nHow to hang the suspension trainer \nThe door anchor \nOnly use the suspension trainer on the side where the door slams shut. This prevents the door from becoming warped and is also less dangerous if someone accidentally opens the door while you are in the middle of an exercise. Preparing your suspension trainer for use with the door anchor is very easy: hang the weighted part of the door anchor over the door and close the door. Then attach the suspension trainer to the anchor with the hook and you\u2019re done! Always check the firmness of the anchorage by pulling firmly on the suspension trainer a few times. \nThe suspension anchor \nThe suspension anchor is the loose yellow ribbon with black seams on it that comes with the suspension trainer. You would think that the different pockets of the suspension anchor are meant to insert the hook of the suspension trainer itself so that you can easily adjust the height. This is not true! Place the hook of the suspension trainer in the lower loop of the suspension anchor. If you do anchor the suspension trainer in the other compartments, the seams can tear out, which can lead to you falling while hanging with your full weight on the suspension trainer. This can lead to nasty injuries or even worse. The pockets in the suspension anchor are intended to hold the hook of the suspension anchor itself. Use the suspension anchor as attachment around, for example, a tree or post. Wrap the anchor around the object as often as possible and fix the hook in one of the previously mentioned pockets. You can also use the hook of the suspension anchor as a loop. \nMaximum load \t250kg \t\nMaximum length \t265cm \t\nSuspension anchor length \t85cm \t\nMore \tMaximum length from attachment to handles: 180cm",

The body is our job & has been for over 15 years. We redesigned the everyday door anchor strap because we got tired of not being able to upload these door anchors properly, worrying about poor construction quality, & having them pull out of door jams too often. The result is our redesigned heavy duty door anchor that stays in any door jam - no matter its size! \nHEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION YOU CAN COUNT ON: Made of ballistic nylon with reinforced double stitched seams. Stainless steel D-ring with extra weave stitched edges. \nEXTRA LARGE STOPPER: We increased the size of the stopper to ensure that IT WILL NOT PULL OUT! We also made it thicker to ensure you have shock absorbing properties during any resistance band workout. This protects your door! \nWILL NOT SCRATCH OR DAMAGE YOUR DOOR: The dense foam padded door stopper will not scratch or damage your door - no matter the exercise. \nFits Into Any Door Jam Safely! \nOversized door stopper will not pull out & will not damage the door! Extra thick pad also provides cushioning during any workout. \nReinforced In Every Way \nMade of ballistic nylon. Double stitched on all seams. Built to outlast the competition & give you years of unparalleled workout versatility! \nClip It & Load It \nWith our increased durability & features that most door anchors do not have, you can upload our door anchor & it will NOT pull out! \nStainless Steel D-rings \nWill not bend under tension & provides you a durable ballistic nylon strap that takes years of abuse - no matter the workout you require!",
