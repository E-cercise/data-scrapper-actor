            "2 in 1 Upper Body Training Machine: Perform back extensions and abdominal crunches from the same seated position. The rotary flywheel mechanism allows for complete control over your starting position. Replaced the installation of the limiters, a simple plug can be completed between the back extension and AB crunch mode conversion. Designed to save space and money by combining two commonly separate machines, into one compact, multi-function machine.",
            "Perfect Bottom Support: This AB back machine has 8 adjustable positions of foot restraints. Adjustable distance range: 31.4\u2018\u2019- 36.3\u2018\u2019. You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",
            "Adequate Back Support: The 2 inch padded cushion is made with a high quality leatherette surface that is easy to clean while guaranteeing comfort during your workout. The seat height also has five adjustable options, with an adjustable height range of 20.8''-24.7'', so don't worry about height being a limitation to your use of this upper body training equipment.",
            "Full Range Adjustable: Rotary flywheel mechanism and pop pin design allow for easy adjustment. 27 selectable holes that enable you to achieve over 180 degrees of adjustment. It allows for complete control over your starting position.",
            "Sculpt Core Muscles: The core acts as the center of your body and helps you utilize every other part of your body to maximum efficiency. Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."

This way your hydraulics will stay in outstanding condition for much longer. \nDo the hydraulics on the exerciser leak oil during training? \nAbsolutely not. The premium hydraulics built into the ShredForce are durable and made to feel absolutely outstanding during workouts - no leaks, no other issues. \nWho can benefit from the ShredForce? \nThe compact form combined with a wide resistance range makes the ShredForce a great option for traveling athletes, people just getting back into training, folks who live in smaller spaces, and anyone who needs an extra boost of upper body strength. \nWill the ShredForce replace my dumbbells? \nWhile most people will be perfectly satisfied with the upper body workouts they can perform with the Shredforce, it isn't made to be a direct replacement for dumbbells, but rather a complement that covers the needs your dumbbells don't. \nComparison Table \n\t\nShredForce \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast Lite \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer Lite \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n231 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\nPrice \n\t$38.24$38.24 \t$119.99$119.99 \t$144.49$144.49 \t$76.49$76.49 \t$118.99$118.99 \t\nIntended Use \n\tUpper Body \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes, Hips, Core, Hamstrings \tWhole Body \t\nWeight Capacity \n\tN/A \t265 lbs \t220 lbs \t330 lbs \t330 lbs \t\nComfortable Padding \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nFoldable \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nDimensions Unfolded \n\tFolded: 16.93\u201d \u00d7 6.30\u201d \u00d7 1.97\" \t43.3\u201d L x 22.5\" W x 19.7\" H \t50.6'' L x 19.7'' W x 19.2'' H \t38.8'' L x 22'' W x 27--34'' H \t35.4\" x 16.5\" x 28.0\" x 39.8\" \t\nIncludes Exercise Chart \n\t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\nAdjustable Height \n\t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nSpecial Features \n\t22- 440 lbs Resistance \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014",

        "features": [
            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."

        "description": "Product DescriptionPerform a variety of ab exercises easily, effectively, and safely with the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20). The adjustable, ergonomic AB crunch bench seat can be adjusted into 3 different positions to accommodate a wide range of heights and motion. The AB workout bench seat is angled at 45-degrees and reclines to 2 different 5-degree angles for a wide range of motion. This abdominal bench with adjustable length, textured grip handles, standard weight post, and 2-position footrests make it is comfortable and easy to perform exercises such as ab crunches and knee raises. When assembled the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20) measures 64 by 11 by 46 inches (L x W x H). The frame is backed by the Best Fitness 3-year Warranty and the parts are backed by a 1 year warranty.Amazon.comMake any time crunch time with the Best Fitness BFAB20 semi-recumbent ab crunch. Unlike some other ab machines--which require the agility of an acrobat to be thoroughly effective--the BFAB20 puts you in a comfortable seated position without sacrificing your workout efficiency. The ergonomically designed machine is built to help you tighten up your midsection, strengthen your back, and improve your core stability, with your choice of toning your lower abs with knees raises or your upper abs with abdominal crunches. To perform ab crunches, simply use the upholstered upper back support, textured grip handles, and standard weight post. Performing knee raises is just as easy thanks to the adjustable-length, two-position footrests. Add in a three-position upholstered seat--which starts at 45 degrees but offers two additional 5-degree reclining positions--and you have everything you need to design an effective ab regimen in the comfort of your own home.  The BFAB20 is an essential workout accessory because your core is where all your body movements originate. Your abdominal muscles support and protect your internal organs and aid in breathing, especially when you exhale. The abs also team up with your back muscles to control trunk motions, such as twisting and bending. The BFAB20 takes the next step by also strengthening and toning the front of the thighs and increasing hip flexibility. The end results include a flatter stomach, better defined abs, well-developed obliques, a more upright posture, and greater support for your spine. Other features include a 1.75-inch upholstered seat, a durable powder-coated finish, and safety pins and bolts that allow for easy disassembly or permanent setup. The BFAB20 measures 22 by 46 by 64 inches (W x H x D) and carries a three-year warranty.",

            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."
