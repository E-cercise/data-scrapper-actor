            "\u3010Transform Your Wall into a Gym\u3011With this versatile cable pulley system, you can do multiple fitness exercises at home. Whether you want to build strength, tone muscles, or improve endurance, this system has you covered.",
            "\u3010Innovative Pulley Design\u3011Unlike other products with only two pulleys on the rack, our cable pulley system gym has four pulleys on the rack and one on the loading pin, making it super smooth and very quiet. The pulleys on sides can keep the cable parallel on the wall, preventing the cable from interfering with the rise of the weight block.",
            "\u3010Multifunctional Fitness Equipment\u3011Our wall mounted cable machine can help you perform various exercises to train your upper body, lower body and core muscles. It comes with a tricep rope, a pull down rope and a straight bar, which can be used for different LAT cable attachments. It can also be used as a pull-up bar and a punching bag hanger.",
            "\u3010Super Stable and Durable\u3011The 12 hole design of our wall mounted pull up bar is more stable and safer than other products. It can support up to 400 lbs of weight and is made of high-quality iron material. It is easy to install and comes with all the mounting hardware you need.",
            "\u3010Satisfaction Guarantee\u3011We are confident that you will love our wall mounted cable pulley system gym, but if you are not satisfied for any reason, please feel free to contact our 24-hour customer service."

Tighten them if necessary to ensure the unit remains safe and stable.",
