        "description": "Product DescriptionPerform a variety of ab exercises easily, effectively, and safely with the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20). The adjustable, ergonomic AB crunch bench seat can be adjusted into 3 different positions to accommodate a wide range of heights and motion. The AB workout bench seat is angled at 45-degrees and reclines to 2 different 5-degree angles for a wide range of motion. This abdominal bench with adjustable length, textured grip handles, standard weight post, and 2-position footrests make it is comfortable and easy to perform exercises such as ab crunches and knee raises. When assembled the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20) measures 64 by 11 by 46 inches (L x W x H). The frame is backed by the Best Fitness 3-year Warranty and the parts are backed by a 1 year warranty.Amazon.comMake any time crunch time with the Best Fitness BFAB20 semi-recumbent ab crunch. Unlike some other ab machines--which require the agility of an acrobat to be thoroughly effective--the BFAB20 puts you in a comfortable seated position without sacrificing your workout efficiency. The ergonomically designed machine is built to help you tighten up your midsection, strengthen your back, and improve your core stability, with your choice of toning your lower abs with knees raises or your upper abs with abdominal crunches. To perform ab crunches, simply use the upholstered upper back support, textured grip handles, and standard weight post. Performing knee raises is just as easy thanks to the adjustable-length, two-position footrests. Add in a three-position upholstered seat--which starts at 45 degrees but offers two additional 5-degree reclining positions--and you have everything you need to design an effective ab regimen in the comfort of your own home.  The BFAB20 is an essential workout accessory because your core is where all your body movements originate. Your abdominal muscles support and protect your internal organs and aid in breathing, especially when you exhale. The abs also team up with your back muscles to control trunk motions, such as twisting and bending. The BFAB20 takes the next step by also strengthening and toning the front of the thighs and increasing hip flexibility. The end results include a flatter stomach, better defined abs, well-developed obliques, a more upright posture, and greater support for your spine. Other features include a 1.75-inch upholstered seat, a durable powder-coated finish, and safety pins and bolts that allow for easy disassembly or permanent setup. The BFAB20 measures 22 by 46 by 64 inches (W x H x D) and carries a three-year warranty.",

            "My name is Jennifer, and this is my first month using my cable machine home gym. As a busy professional, I've always wanted to be able to work out my whole body at home\u2014not just by running or doing simple yoga routines. So, I began searching for gym equipment that could meet all my full-body training needs.",
            "After careful comparison, I finally decided on this multi-functional fitness equipment, primarily because of its wide range of workout options and customizable adjustment features. First, it\u2019s equipped with 13 weight pieces totaling 143 pounds, with adjustable weights that suit not only me but also my husband and family, meeting various fitness levels.",
            "With this gym equipment, I do chest flys, leg training, pull-ups, low rows, chest presses, shoulder presses, leg extensions, and more. It allows me to comprehensively train my chest, back, legs, and even smaller muscles like abs and calves. It really covers everything, helping me achieve the results I want.",
            "My family and I particularly appreciate the flexibility of this functional trainer. For instance, the butterfly arms can be adjusted to three levels, the leg press has adjustable height and forward-backward options, and the seat cushion can be set at four levels, providing a different support experience every time and making each workout comfortable and natural.",
            "I also found that the L-shaped steel butterfly arm structure makes the setup very stable. The seat cushion is made from soft materials, so even during long workouts, it\u2019s still comfortable. Most notably, the leg support and curl pad are detachable, so we can store them when not in use to save space. The pulley system of lat pulldown machines is specially designed to operate smoothly and quietly, so I don\u2019t have to worry about disturbing my family.",
            "A few days after buying it, I received the four packages shipped separately. With the detailed installation manual and tools, my husband and I only took a few hours to set it up\u2014easy and convenient.",
            "Now, I work out on this all in one gym every day, and I can already feel significant changes in my body. My husband also loves it; we take turns using it daily and enjoy sharing the fun of working out and the health benefits together. I\u2019m so glad I chose this product. It not only provides a high-quality workout experience but also brings a positive, healthy activity into our home."

            "CHEST PRESS MACHINE PLATE LOADED - Gronk Fitness Seated Chest Press is the ultimate secret weapon if you're serious about building a strong and powerful chest. This beast of a machine is designed to target your pectoral muscles with precision, giving you that chiseled and well-defined chest you've always desired. With adjustable resistance and a comfortable seat, you can push your limits while maintaining proper form",
            "CHEST MACHINE HOME GYM - The seated chest press machine eliminates the need for stabilizing muscles, which are necessary for maintaining balance during a bench press. This results in a focus solely on the chest muscles rather than engaging those that assist in pressing movements, which may not align with functional fitness goals. Place up to 220lbs on each weight horn with standard 2-inch olympic plates",
            "PERFECT FOR HOME OR COMMERCIAL GYM - Compact machine for home gyms, commercial gyms or smaller workout spaces",
            "BENEFITS - This machine targets the pectorals, the main muscles of the chest. The same muscles you use when pushing a grocery cart or to get up off the floor. The chest press machine also recruits the biceps and the big muscles of the shoulders and back. That makes this exercise especially beneficial for those who participate in sports that involve the swinging of a bat, racket or golf club",
            "BUILD GREATNESS - Get ready to redefine your fitness journey with Gronk Fitness. Join the movement and experience the difference with Gronk Fitness \u2013 where power meets precision, and every workout propels you closer to your fitness aspirations"

You can implement it into squats, deadlifts, hip thrusts, bench presses, and bicep curls. \nSmith machines make Home Gym easier, especially if you are a woman or new to the gym. \nThe smith machine with a barbell supported on each side and a pulley system moving the weights. Because the bar is moving on a track, it can only move up and down. Safety bars restrict the bar from moving further than you would like, and springs absorb some impacts when dropped, keeping you from getting injured. \nYou can use a smith machine for the following reasons: \nTo get familiar with a specific exercise and its form thereof before trying it with free weights\nTo isolate a particular group of muscles for strength purposes or because of muscle imbalances\nTo prepare you for an exercise that you are unable to do\nFamiliarize Yourself With An Exercise On The Smith Machine \nTo get rid of the jitters you might have about trying a free weight movement. Squat, deadlifts, or hip thrusts can be very intimidating, especially if you have never done it before.\nTo identify the movement pattern and the placement of your feet and get the feel of the bar without having to manage a standard barbell of 45 pounds on your shoulders or in your hands.",

            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."

This way your hydraulics will stay in outstanding condition for much longer. \nDo the hydraulics on the exerciser leak oil during training? \nAbsolutely not. The premium hydraulics built into the ShredForce are durable and made to feel absolutely outstanding during workouts - no leaks, no other issues. \nWho can benefit from the ShredForce? \nThe compact form combined with a wide resistance range makes the ShredForce a great option for traveling athletes, people just getting back into training, folks who live in smaller spaces, and anyone who needs an extra boost of upper body strength. \nWill the ShredForce replace my dumbbells? \nWhile most people will be perfectly satisfied with the upper body workouts they can perform with the Shredforce, it isn't made to be a direct replacement for dumbbells, but rather a complement that covers the needs your dumbbells don't. \nComparison Table \n\t\nShredForce \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast Lite \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer Lite \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n231 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\nPrice \n\t$38.24$38.24 \t$119.99$119.99 \t$144.49$144.49 \t$76.49$76.49 \t$118.99$118.99 \t\nIntended Use \n\tUpper Body \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes, Hips, Core, Hamstrings \tWhole Body \t\nWeight Capacity \n\tN/A \t265 lbs \t220 lbs \t330 lbs \t330 lbs \t\nComfortable Padding \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nFoldable \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nDimensions Unfolded \n\tFolded: 16.93\u201d \u00d7 6.30\u201d \u00d7 1.97\" \t43.3\u201d L x 22.5\" W x 19.7\" H \t50.6'' L x 19.7'' W x 19.2'' H \t38.8'' L x 22'' W x 27--34'' H \t35.4\" x 16.5\" x 28.0\" x 39.8\" \t\nIncludes Exercise Chart \n\t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\nAdjustable Height \n\t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nSpecial Features \n\t22- 440 lbs Resistance \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014",

The high-density, dual-layered pad folds down for the incline bench feature and acts as an ab crunch board. The foam ankle pads secure the user and support ankles and knees when performing ab crunches. The safety catches allow each arm to be rested when not in use and protect the user in the event the lift cannot be completed. Each safety catch, featuring a protective rubber strip, has 9 different adjustment positions using a locking pin, allowing an 8\u201d range. A plate storage peg is featured on both sides of the unit to allow a clean and organized home gym. \nEach weight & storage peg measures 8\u201d long and 1\u201d in diameter. To convert plate storage pegs to 2\" for Olympic style plates, the EX-10 adaptor is sold separately. \nThis weight bench station has a Maximum Weight load of 125 lbs per arm, allowing users to train with up to 250 lbs. total. \nMaximize Your Home Gym Workout - Upper Body & Core Routines \nFlat Bench- Chest Press \nFlat bench presses are best for overall development of the pectoralis, commonly known as the pecs or your chest muscles. With this natural and fluid movement, it is likely to assist you in daily life activities as well as other exercises! \nIncline Bench - Chest Press \nWith a similar movement to the flat bench, performing incline bench presses will activate your shoulders as well as the upper part of the pecs. The incline press puts less strain on your rotator cuff while activating the deltoids. \nAb Crunch Feature \nUsing the high density pad supports by the head of the bench, you can secure yourself by placing your feet behind them and perform ab crunches while the bench is in the incline position, allowing you to add more variation to your workout! \n\t\n2\" Storage Peg Adaptor \nOlympic Style Bumper Plates \nIndependent Arm Bench Press Station \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.4 out of 5 stars \n523 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n13 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n232 \n\t\nPrice $24.98$24.98 \t$173.98$173.98 \t$348.98$348.98 \t\nCompatible Converts 1\" storage peg to 2\" storage peg \tPolyurethane Bumper Plates \tX \t\nStyle 2\" Olympic \t2\" Olympic Steel Hole \tFlat - Incline Chest Bench Press \t\nEmpower your fitness journey with Valor Fitness.

The safety catches allow each arm to be rested when not in use and protect the user in the event the lift cannot be completed. Each safety catch, featuring a protective rubber strip, has 9 different adjustment positions using a locking pin, allowing an 8\u201d range. A plate storage peg is featured on both sides of the unit to allow a clean and organized home gym. \nEach weight & storage peg measures 8\u201d long and 1\u201d in diameter. To convert plate storage pegs to 2\" for Olympic style plates, the EX-10 adaptor is sold separately. \nThis weight bench station has a Maximum Weight load of 125 lbs per arm, allowing users to train with up to 250 lbs. total.",

        "features": [
            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."
