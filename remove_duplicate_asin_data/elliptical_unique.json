For specific dimensions, please refer to the product page for each model. For proper, comfortable use, allow at least 2-3 inches of clearance between the underside of your desk and your knees. \nCan I stand on Cubii ellipticals? \nNo. Currently, we only manufacture seated ellipticals. Please do not stand on any Cubii elliptical product. \nHow easy is it to move my Cubii elliptical around? \nCubii ellipticals are designed to be easily moved to wherever you love to sit. Each model varies in transportability with corresponding features such as lightweight construction, carrying handles, and/or built-in wheels. \nPrevious page\nNext page\n1 Move & Grippii Mat Combo 2 Move + Cushii \nFind More Great Products From Cubii \nPrevious page\nNext page",
