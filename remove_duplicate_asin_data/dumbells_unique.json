Our fitness weights feature a solid textured grip. The handle design features a curved center that contours to the natural arch of your hand giving the user a secure but not overly aggressive feel for a truly exceptional workout experience. The solid steel polypropylene coated bars are 17 inches long to provide ample space to accommodate the 6 interchangeable vinyl plates. The mid-point of the Handlebar measures 1.1 inches in diameter. This set includes (4) 1.5 lb weights, (4) 2.5 lb weights, and (4) 5 lb weights totaling 40 pounds when fully assembled. Polypropylene locking collar stars (0.2 lb each) tighten to hold the plates in place even during intense movements. Add or remove the smooth incremental plates to target muscles in your arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, and core while preventing damage to floors and surfaces compared to cast iron counterparts. Eliminate the need for a large rack in your in-home workout area as you easily assemble different weight amounts to use during full body toning workouts.",

We often ship weight products in multiple boxes to ensure that your order arrives in perfect condition. By dividing heavy or bulky items into several manageable packages, we prevent damage during transit and reduce the risk of injury for delivery personnel, who can handle lighter boxes more easily. This approach also allows for better distribution of weight, resulting in faster delivery times.

Don't be afraid to lift heavy weights, use POWER GUIDANCE's Barbell Pads to get the support you need! \nThe biggest complaint against using a pad is that it reduces stability during your lifting. With our anti-slip design, you can have comfort without sacrificing stability! It comes with two velcros to ensure the pads don't slide up and down the bar, which makes you focus on training. Lift more weight, more often and get more results! \nWorks great with Olympic barbells and smith machine. You only need to adjust the velcro to make the pad hold the barbell bar tightly. \nWhen you squat, hip thrust, lunge, hip bridge and do other weight lifting training, it will protect your pelvis, shoulders, neck, and other parts of the muscles and joints from bruising. \n\t\nWeight Lifting Leather Belt \nPOWER GUIDANCE Barbell Pad \nPOWER GUIDANCE Barbell Pad \nPOWER GUIDANCE Barbell Pad \nPOWER GUIDANCE Barbell Pad \n3 IN 1 Dumbbell \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n3.7 out of 5 stars \n16 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n900 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n900 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n11,635 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n11,635 \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n45 \n\t\nPrice \u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t$9.99$9.99 \t$9.99$9.99 \t$39.99$39.99 \t\nFeatures Middle Groove, Sturdy and Durable \tLightweigMiddle Groove, Sturdy and Durableht, Easy to Pack \tSturMiddle Groove, Sturdy and Durabledy and Durable, Easy to Wipe Clean \tLightweight,Easy to Pack \tLightweight,Easy to Pack \tAchieve Peak Exercise Performance while Minimizing Stress on Joints \t\nBarbell Squat 5 Star Recommendation \t5 Star Recommendation \t5 Star Recommendation \t4 Star Recommendation \t4 Star Recommendation \t4 Star Recommendation \t\nHip Thrust 5 Star Recommendation \t5 Star Recommendation \t5 Star Recommendation \t4 Star Recommendation \t4 Star Recommendation \t5 Star Recommendation \t\nFasteners High \tDual Velcro Fasteners \tDual Velcro Fasteners \tTwo Velcro Tapes in Opposite Directions \tTwo Velcro Tapes in Opposite Directions \tErgonomic handle \t\nDurability Higher \tHigher \tHigher \tHigh \tHigh \tHigher \t\nWaterproof \t\t\t\t\t\u2713 \t\nMulti Exercise Application Barbell Squat, Hip Thrust, Lunges, Hip Bridges, Bench Press \tBarbell Squat, Hip Thrust, Lunges, Hip Bridges, Bench Press \tBarbell Squat, Hip Thrust, Lunges, Hip Bridges, Bench Press \tBarbell Squat, Hip Thrust, Lunges, Hip Bridges, Bench Press \tBarbell Squat, Hip Thrust, Lunges, Hip Bridges, Bench Press \tAbility to use the dumbbell for various exercises, including as a medicine ball, kettlebell, and dumbbell. \t\nMore Colors Options \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \tX",

            "rawText": "From the Publisher\n\nAchieve fitness and sport performance goals with dumbbell training \nOne of the most versatile and effective forms of equipment, dumbbells have long been part of the training formula for building strength and power and toning the entire body. Dumbbell Training, Second Edition, describes how to use dumbbells as a primary mode of training to achieve your goals related to fitness, weight loss, or increased muscle mass. \nThe book is loaded with more than 110 exercises targeting the core, upper body, lower body, and total body. \nYou\u2019ll also find 66 ready-to-use programs that target your specific goals related to fitness, weight loss, increased muscle mass, or improved athletic performance. \nSample content \nPage 18, Introduction Cycle \nThe introduction cycle reacquaints the individuals with the demands of resistance training. The full number of repetitions in each set determines the intensity. Individuals select a resistance that allows them to complete the full number of repetitions in each set using good form, forcing them to use a moderate resistance. In some of the later cycles, the first set determines the intensity. The person selects a resistance he or she can lift for the full number of repetitions on the first set and perhaps the second set, but if the resistance is selected correctly, the person should not be able to complete the full number of repetitions in subsequent sets. The pace, or speed of movement, used during the introduction cycle is relatively slow; whereas, the rest periods between sets and exercises are fairly long. \nPage 64, Decline Press \nInstructions \n1. Lie faceup on a decline exercise bench. \n2. Hold the dumbbells laterally at chest height. \n3. Simultaneously press both dumbbells up until both arms are fully extended directly above the shoulders. \n4. Lower the dumbbells under control to the start position. \nCommon Errors \n\u2022 Performing the movement too quickly, which reduces the amount of time the muscles are under tension, potentially decreasing the training effect. \n\u2022 Using dumbbells that are too heavy results in the use of improper technique, such as lifting or lowering too quickly, improper body position, and reduced range of motion. \n\u2022 Elevating the hips off the bench excessively arches the lower back. \n\u2022 Limiting the range of motion reduces the training effect. \nPage 47, Lateral Raise \nInstructions \n1. Hold the dumbbells at your sides with a slight bend at the elbow and the palms facing inward so that the dumbbells are resting against the top of the outside of the thighs. \n2. Keeping the elbows slightly bent and without rocking at the torso, maintain a palms-down position and lift the dumbbells laterally to shoulder height. \n3. Pause for a count of one and then lower the dumbbells under control to the start position. \nCommon Errors \n\u2022 Performing the movement too quickly reduces the amount of time the muscles are under tension, potentially decreasing the training effect. \n\u2022 Using dumbbells that are too heavy results in improper technique, such as lifting or lowering too quickly, excessive bending at the elbows, and reduced range of motion. \n\u2022 Using a rocking motion at the torso to generate momentum and assist in the lifting action decreases the training effect on the target muscles. Do not rock your body to create momentum and make the exercise easier.",
