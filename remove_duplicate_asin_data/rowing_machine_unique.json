The resistance is created by the paddle-like blades of the flywheel moving through the water, creating a smooth and natural resistance that closely resembles the feeling of rowing on water. Like water, the harder you fight, the more resistance you get",

Full body workout that includes your legs, core, back and arms. Perfect for all fitness levels. This water rowing machine targets all major muscle groups (84 percent of total muscle mass)",

By the \"rule of cubes\", the amount of work you apply dictates the speed at which you row. From a gentle paddle to a \u201cgive it your all\u201d workout, you are in control When rowing, remember, you are the engine. The amount of work you do is dependent on you, not on the machine. \nThe more work you do, the more resistance/drag you can overcome, and the faster you move. The speed which you can maintain is dependent on the level of work you can maintain and, again, is limited only by you. Row harder and you go faster, row easier and you go slower. This is the self paced nature of the WATERROWER and Rowing and allows Anyone to row regardless of age, sex, size of level of fitness. \nWHY WATER \nINSTANT RESISTANCE \nThe WATERROWER's unique WaterFlywheel design uses a specially formed paddle to cup the moving water, reduce slippage and produce an unrivaled simulation of the benefits of rowing. \nNO JERKING OR JARRING \nThere is no jerkiness or jarring which is often associated with conventional mechanical rowing machines making the exercise unpleasant; only smooth even load, kind to the body, and relaxing to the mind. \nSMOOTH CONNECTION \nThere is no \"solid\" connection between user and the moving water, simply an immersed paddle which dampens out any detrimental mechanical feel Providing some \"give\" is essential for accommodating bad or developing technique, lessening the risk of injury. \nEVEN STROKE \nA uniform stroke is essential to spreading the work more evenly over the muscle groups, working the muscle groups in proportion to their strength, optimizing exercise benefit while reducing risk of injury. \nS4 Monitor \nThe S4 Monitor measures the speed of the paddle using an infrared detector mounted on the underside of the top deck and a castellated Sensor Pickup mounted on the inner clutch bush. The motion of the paddle revolved the sensor disk which in turn triggers the infrared detector \nSeating \nA comfortable seat for rowing is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring a satisfying and effective workout experience. Provides proper cushioning and contouring, while minimizing pressure points and promotes healthy posture. Helps keep your focus on generating powerful and efficient strokes. \nWheels for mobility \nWheels for easing the movement of the machine provide an efficient solution to transporting the rower. These wheels are designed to enhance mobility and maneuverability in various settings, making it effortless to reposition and store without the need for excessive manual effort or additional equipment \n\t\nAsh \nClub \nOak \nWalnut \nCherry \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.5 out of 5 stars \n650 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n359 \n\t\n4.4 out of 5 stars \n174 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n172 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n11 \n\t\nPrice $1,129.00$1,129.00 \t$1,289.00$1,289.00 \t$1,189.00$1,189.00 \t$1,689.00$1,689.00 \t\u2014 \t\nWood Ash \tAsh \tOak \tWalnut \tCherry \t\nAluminum frame \t\t\t\t\t\nUSA made \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\nID 100 NAT \t150 Club \t230 SR \t300 Classic \t200 OX \t\n\t\nA1 \nM1 Hi Rise \nGronk M1 Hi Rise \nGronk Champion \nS1 \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.6 out of 5 stars \n183 \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n23 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n26 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n19 \n\t\n5.0 out of 5 stars \n1 \n\t\nPrice $999.99$999.99 \t$2,139.00$2,139.00 \t$2,139.00$2,139.00 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\nWood Oak \t\t\tAsh \t\t\nAluminum frame \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\t\nSteel frame \t\t\t\t\u2713 \t\nUSA made \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\nID A1 \tM1 Hi Rise \tGronk M1 Hi Rise \tGronk Champion \tS1",

From a gentle paddle to a \u201cgive it your all\u201d workout, you are in control When rowing, remember, you are the engine. The amount of work you do is dependent on you, not on the machine. \nThe more work you do, the more resistance/drag you can overcome, and the faster you move. The speed which you can maintain is dependent on the level of work you can maintain and, again, is limited only by you. Row harder and you go faster, row easier and you go slower. This is the self paced nature of the WATERROWER and Rowing and allows Anyone to row regardless of age, sex, size of level of fitness."

The A1 Oak Rowing Machine is specifically designed to be lightweight, portable, space-saving, and vertically stackable. In fact, 3 A1 rowing machines can be stored vertically in the same amount of space as ONE indoor cycling bike!",
            "Smooth - Water rowers use a water-filled flywheel to provide resistance as you row. The resistance is created by the paddle-like blades of the flywheel moving through the water, creating a smooth and natural resistance that closely resembles the feeling of rowing on water. Like water, the harder you fight, the more resistance you get",

By the \"rule of cubes\", the amount of work you apply dictates the speed at which you row. From a gentle paddle to a \u201cgive it your all\u201d workout, you are in control When rowing, remember, you are the engine. The amount of work you do is dependent on you, not on the machine. \nThe more work you do, the more resistance/drag you can overcome, and the faster you move. The speed which you can maintain is dependent on the level of work you can maintain and, again, is limited only by you. Row harder and you go faster, row easier and you go slower. This is the self paced nature of the WATERROWER and Rowing and allows Anyone to row regardless of age, sex, size of level of fitness. \nWHY WATER \nINSTANT RESISTANCE \nThe WATERROWER's unique WaterFlywheel design uses a specially formed paddle to cup the moving water, reduce slippage and produce an unrivaled simulation of the benefits of rowing. \nNO JERKING OR JARRING \nThere is no jerkiness or jarring which is often associated with conventional mechanical rowing machines making the exercise unpleasant; only smooth even load, kind to the body, and relaxing to the mind. \nSMOOTH CONNECTION \nThere is no \"solid\" connection between user and the moving water, simply an immersed paddle which dampens out any detrimental mechanical feel Providing some \"give\" is essential for accommodating bad or developing technique, lessening the risk of injury. \nEVEN STROKE \nA uniform stroke is essential to spreading the work more evenly over the muscle groups, working the muscle groups in proportion to their strength, optimizing exercise benefit while reducing risk of injury. \nS4 Monitor \nThe S4 Monitor measures the speed of the paddle using an infrared detector mounted on the underside of the top deck and a castellated Sensor Pickup mounted on the inner clutch bush. The motion of the paddle revolved the sensor disk which in turn triggers the infrared detector \nSeating \nA comfortable seat for rowing is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring a satisfying and effective workout experience. Provides proper cushioning and contouring, while minimizing pressure points and promotes healthy posture. Helps keep your focus on generating powerful and efficient strokes. \nWheels for mobility \nWheels for easing the movement of the machine provide an efficient solution to transporting the rower. These wheels are designed to enhance mobility and maneuverability in various settings, making it effortless to reposition and store without the need for excessive manual effort or additional equipment \n\t\nAsh \nClub \nOak \nWalnut \nCherry \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.5 out of 5 stars \n650 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n359 \n\t\n4.4 out of 5 stars \n174 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n172 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n11 \n\t\nPrice $1,129.00$1,129.00 \t$1,289.00$1,289.00 \t$1,189.00$1,189.00 \t$1,689.00$1,689.00 \t\u2014 \t\nWood Ash \tAsh \tOak \tWalnut \tCherry \t\nAluminum frame \t\t\t\t\t\nUSA made \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\nID 100 NAT \t150 Club \t230 SR \t300 Classic \t200 OX \t\n\t\nA1 \nM1 Hi Rise \nGronk M1 Hi Rise \nGronk Champion \nS1 \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.6 out of 5 stars \n183 \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n23 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n26 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n19 \n\t\n5.0 out of 5 stars \n1 \n\t\nPrice $999.99$999.99 \t$2,139.00$2,139.00 \t$2,139.00$2,139.00 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\nWood Oak \t\t\tAsh \t\t\nAluminum frame \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\t\nSteel frame \t\t\t\t\u2713 \t\nUSA made \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\nID A1 \tM1 Hi Rise \tGronk M1 Hi Rise \tGronk Champion \tS1",

From a gentle paddle to a \u201cgive it your all\u201d workout, you are in control When rowing, remember, you are the engine. The amount of work you do is dependent on you, not on the machine. \nThe more work you do, the more resistance/drag you can overcome, and the faster you move. The speed which you can maintain is dependent on the level of work you can maintain and, again, is limited only by you. Row harder and you go faster, row easier and you go slower. This is the self paced nature of the WATERROWER and Rowing and allows Anyone to row regardless of age, sex, size of level of fitness."

Four ultra-quiet triple rollers evenly distribute the load weight, making it easy to transport and move. The maximum load-bearing capacity is 350LBS.",
            "\u3010Precise Bluetooth LED Monitor with Adjustable Tablet Stand\u3011The LED-Display is equipped with a freely adjustable stand, which can firmly fix different devices such as mobile phones or tablets, and then connect to all APPs that support the FTMS protocol (such as Kinomap) via Bluetooth to get an immersive rowing motion. The backlight function can monitor all exercise data in real time more clearly and effectively, such as heart rate, calories, number of rowing, rowing distance, etc.",
            "\u3010Exercise Full Body Muscle Groups\u3011Indoor rowing can exercise core muscle groups, increase endurance and burn calories more effectively. In just 20 minutes, you can exercise more than 90% of the major muscle groups, and you can exercise at any time without going outdoors to exercise or becoming a gym member. The adjustable foot pedal allows you to fine-tune the leg position and sitting posture, and effectively exercise while minimizing the risk of injury.",

        "description": "The all NEW Assault Air Bike is a modernly designed take on a very old traditional air resistance bike. Fixing everything that was wrong and implementing new technology. Strengthening all pivot points and upgrading them with bearings instead of bushings to provide a powerfully smooth operation. Work out with no limits due to the unlimited resistance provided by air.

By the \"rule of cubes\", the amount of work you apply dictates the speed at which you row. From a gentle paddle to a \u201cgive it your all\u201d workout, you are in control When rowing, remember, you are the engine. The amount of work you do is dependent on you, not on the machine. \nThe more work you do, the more resistance/drag you can overcome, and the faster you move. The speed which you can maintain is dependent on the level of work you can maintain and, again, is limited only by you. Row harder and you go faster, row easier and you go slower. This is the self paced nature of the WATERROWER and Rowing and allows Anyone to row regardless of age, sex, size of level of fitness. \nWHY WATER \nINSTANT RESISTANCE \nThe WATERROWER's unique WaterFlywheel design uses a specially formed paddle to cup the moving water, reduce slippage and produce an unrivaled simulation of the benefits of rowing. \nNO JERKING OR JARRING \nThere is no jerkiness or jarring which is often associated with conventional mechanical rowing machines making the exercise unpleasant; only smooth even load, kind to the body, and relaxing to the mind. \nSMOOTH CONNECTION \nThere is no \"solid\" connection between user and the moving water, simply an immersed paddle which dampens out any detrimental mechanical feel Providing some \"give\" is essential for accommodating bad or developing technique, lessening the risk of injury. \nEVEN STROKE \nA uniform stroke is essential to spreading the work more evenly over the muscle groups, working the muscle groups in proportion to their strength, optimizing exercise benefit while reducing risk of injury. \nS4 Monitor \nThe S4 Monitor measures the speed of the paddle using an infrared detector mounted on the underside of the top deck and a castellated Sensor Pickup mounted on the inner clutch bush. The motion of the paddle revolved the sensor disk which in turn triggers the infrared detector \nSeating \nA comfortable seat for rowing is essential for optimizing performance and ensuring a satisfying and effective workout experience. Provides proper cushioning and contouring, while minimizing pressure points and promotes healthy posture. Helps keep your focus on generating powerful and efficient strokes. \nWheels for mobility \nWheels for easing the movement of the machine provide an efficient solution to transporting the rower. These wheels are designed to enhance mobility and maneuverability in various settings, making it effortless to reposition and store without the need for excessive manual effort or additional equipment \n\t\nAsh \nClub \nOak \nWalnut \nCherry \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.5 out of 5 stars \n650 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n359 \n\t\n4.4 out of 5 stars \n174 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n172 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n11 \n\t\nPrice $1,129.00$1,129.00 \t$1,289.00$1,289.00 \t$1,189.00$1,189.00 \t$1,689.00$1,689.00 \t\u2014 \t\nWood Ash \tAsh \tOak \tWalnut \tCherry \t\nAluminum frame \t\t\t\t\t\nUSA made \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\nID 100 NAT \t150 Club \t230 SR \t300 Classic \t200 OX \t\n\t\nA1 \nM1 Hi Rise \nGronk M1 Hi Rise \nGronk Champion \nS1 \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.6 out of 5 stars \n183 \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n23 \n\t\n4.0 out of 5 stars \n26 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n19 \n\t\n5.0 out of 5 stars \n1 \n\t\nPrice $999.99$999.99 \t$2,139.00$2,139.00 \t$2,139.00$2,139.00 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\nWood Oak \t\t\tAsh \t\t\nAluminum frame \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\t\nSteel frame \t\t\t\t\u2713 \t\nUSA made \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\nID A1 \tM1 Hi Rise \tGronk M1 Hi Rise \tGronk Champion \tS1",

By the \"rule of cubes\", the amount of work you apply dictates the speed at which you row. From a gentle paddle to a \u201cgive it your all\u201d workout, you are in control When rowing, remember, you are the engine. The amount of work you do is dependent on you, not on the machine. \nThe more work you do, the more resistance/drag you can overcome, and the faster you move. The speed which you can maintain is dependent on the level of work you can maintain and, again, is limited only by you. Row harder and you go faster, row easier and you go slower. This is the self paced nature of the WATERROWER and Rowing and allows Anyone to row regardless of age, sex, size of level of fitness."

            "Reliable Workout Data : The powerful PM5 Performance Monitor, standard with every RowErg, provides repeatable, comparable data for every workout. The PM5 offers a simple \u201cJust Row\u201d mode or allows you to set up a variety of workouts. The monitor shows you a wide range of data, including pace, watts, stroke rate and Calories and automatically stores this information in either its internal memory or a USB drive.",
            "Get Connected : One monitor, many training options! Our open-platform Performance Monitor connects via Bluetooth to your smartphone or tablet and is compatible with over 30 different apps, including our own ErgData. Whether you\u2019re after online classes, coaching and training programs or virtual racing, there\u2019s an app to suit you.",
            "Integrated Device Holder : Now it\u2019s easier than ever to use ErgData, or any of your other favorite apps, while rowing. Each new RowErg comes with a device holder that allows you to keep your smartphone or tablet securely in place. The device holder fits everything from small smartphones to large tablets such as the iPad Pro and is easily and quickly adjustable.",
            "One Machine, Two Height Options : Our standard RowErg has a 14\u201d seat height, while our elevated version has taller legs that provide a 20\u201d seat height. The elevated version is a good choice if you like the convenience and appearance of a taller machine. The increased seat height can also make it easier to get on and off.",
            "Flywheel and Damper : Our RowErgs use air resistance to respond to your effort on every stroke, so you are in full control of your exertion and resistance at all times. The spiral damper allows you to easily adjust the airflow to the flywheel, so you can change the feel of the stroke to suit your preference. The flywheel design minimizes noise while maximizing a smooth feel.",
            "Storage and Mobility : The RowErg is easy to wheel around for workouts and can be quickly separated into two pieces (no tools required) for compact storage. Ideal for homes or gyms that need flexible space. The taller legs of the elevated version feature large caster wheels for easier moving.",
            "Adjustable Footrests and Ergonomic Handle : Adjustable footrests allow for quick and easy sizing to fit a wide range of shoe sizes. We designed the ergonomic handle with a 10-degree bend that allows you to row comfortably with a natural arm and hand position."

        "description": "Two-in-One Cardio The Avari\u00ae Conversion II Rower/Recumbent Bike provides two low-impact cardiovascular workouts in one space-saving machine: cycling and rowing. Whether using the rowing machine to strengthen and tone your total body or the recumbent bike to firm your lower body, this magnetic resistance machine delivers a complete workout that's as hardcore - or not - as you want. To adjust the intensity mid routine, simply turn the grip-edged, 8-resistance-level dial to adjust your pace without interrupting the smooth, quiet workout. Switching from a stationary recumbent workout to indoor rowing - or vice versa - is a cinch. Just pull the pin and enjoy your workout as the padded seat glides along our ball bearing roller system for consistently smooth rowing at any resistance level. When you're ready to log some recumbent biking miles, adjust the seat to your leg length, re-insert the pin, start your healthy journey. More Tech for Your Buck The Avari\u00ae Conversion II Rower/Recumbent Bike features a multi-functional electronic fitness monitor that displays all the information you need to remain motivated. Track your speed, distance, time, odometer, heart rate and calories burned so you can keep an eye on the finish line and find the will to power through. When you're not testing your mettle and sculpting your body, simply fold the machine and store it out of the way for next time. Built to Accommodate You for Life In addition to quickly changing exercises modes and adjusting intensity & workout duration settings, the machine lets you just as easily adjust other settings for your body. The adjustable foot straps on both pairs of purposefully oversized foot pedals will securely hold your feet. While in bike mode, the foot straps allow a pulling motion that establishes an advantageous push/pull movement that many competing exercise bikes fail to provide. Similarly beneficial, the heavy-duty nylon rowing strap with foam hand grips offers stable, comfortable hand placement while rowing.
