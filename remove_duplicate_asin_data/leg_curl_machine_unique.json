            "rawText": "From the manufacturer\nMarcy Two Piece Olympic Weight Bench with Leg Developer and Squat Rack \nLooking to increase overall body strength and lean muscle mass while increasing your metabolic rate to burn calories? The Marcy MD-879 is your solution. The unique two-piece bench design allows you to utilize the upright bar support for squats and lunges, while the bench doubles as a stand-alone utility bench for lower leg, abdominal and bicep exercises. This bench features fully adjustable back pad for incline, decline and flat chest press exercises. With contoured foam roller pads that support form, you can get a total leg workout. The adjustable barbell crutches allows you to easily change the height of bar to conform to your workout needs. The built-in post on the machine conveniently organizes and stores weight plates. Included is an adjustable preacher curl pad with detachable bicep curl bar that allows extended bicep workouts. This all-in-one set is an ideal choice for any level user looking to building, toning and maintaining muscle mass. \nAdjustability \nThe Marcy Two-Piece Olympic Bench MD-879 is adjustable at several points for your convenience. Adjust the back pad to decline, flat, and incline angles to change up your workout. And, the barbell catch / squat rack and adjustable curl pad are height adjustable for your comfort. \nSeparate Bench and Bar Catch / Squat Rack \nUnlike many Olympic benches, the MD-879 barbell catch / squat rack is not attached to the bench. Simply move the bench away from the barbell catch to use it as a squat rack. \nIncluded Storage Space for Weight Plates \nFor added convenience, the MD-879 Olympic Bench barbell catch has two Olympic pegs to store your weight plates and avoid cluttering your workout space. \nPreacher Curls with Preacher Curl Pad and Curl Handle \nUse the preacher curl pad and curl handle for preacher curls. Preacher curls take better aim at your biceps than regular curls. \nLeg Extensions with Leg Developer \nThe included leg developer provides the option to do leg curls and leg extensions. Leg extensions are great for working out your quadriceps \nIncline Bench Exercises \u2013 Incline Presses \nWith multiple backpad positions, the MD-879 provides a wide array of angles to pinpoint specific muscles. Incline Bench Presses target your chest muscles as presses do, however, the incline bench press focuses more on your upper chest muscles. \n\t\nMarcy Competitor Adjustable Olympic Weight Bench with Leg Developer CB-729 \nMarcy Olympic Weight Bench for Full-Body Workout MD-857 \nMarcy Adjustable Olympic Weight Bench with Leg Developer and Squat Rack MD-879 \nMarcy Competitor Adjustable Olympic Weight Bench with Leg Developer MWB-4491 \nMarcy Folding Standard Weight Bench \u2013 Easy Storage MWB-20100 \nMarcy Competitor Standard Workout Bench with 80 lbs Weight Set CB-20111 \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.4 out of 5 stars \n653 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n6,261 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n6,261 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n167 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n985 \n\t\n4.2 out of 5 stars \n1,475 \n\t\nPrice $179.99$179.99 \t$299.98$299.98 \t$197.97$197.97 \t$149.99$149.99 \t\u2014 \t$139.99$139.99 \t\nItem Dimensions 64L x 46W x 55.5H inches \t80L x 47W x 60.5H inches \t74L x 60W x 64H inches \t65L x 46W x 55.5H inches \t69L x 29W x 49.5H inches \t59L x 48W x 50H inches \t\nAvailable Back Support Positions 5 \t4 \t6 \t5 \t4 \t3 \t\nWeight Rating Rated for up to 600 lb \tRated for up to 600 lb \tRated for up to 600 lb \tRated for up to 600 lb \tRated for up to 600 lb \tRated for up to 600 lb \t\nMax User Weight Capacity 300 lb \t300 lb \t300 lb \t300 lb \t300 lb \t300 lb \t\nMax Weight Capacity on Leg Developer 100 lb \t100 lb \t100 lb \t100 lb \t100 lb \t50 lb \t\nLeg Developer Post Size 1\" standard & 2\" Olympic \t1\" standard & 2\" Olympic \t1\" standard & 2\" Olympic \t1\" standard & 2\" Olympic \t1\" standard & 2\" Olympic \t1\" Standard \t\nPreacher Curl Pad \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\t\u2713 \t\t\nOther Features Height adjustable barbell crutches (41.5\" - 55.5\") \t2 Olympic weight storage post, Protective striker plate \tHeight adjustable barbell crutches (44.5\" - 64\"), 2 Olympic weight storage post, 2-piece design \tHeight adjustable barbell crutches (41.5\" - 55.5\") \tAdjustable Preacher curl pad, foldable for easy storage \tIncludes 80-lb weight set",

            "Kneeling pads included with each flat Ab Roller provide extra comfort and support. Designed for users who want to take the pressure off their knees during their workout without having to purchase an additional one. A timer is also included as well as a beginner's movement guide.",
            "The flat panel design provides more stability than a traditional AB roller. You don't have to think about how to keep your balance and whether there's a risk of breaking it due to the large body weight, meaning that you can fully concentrate on your exercise.",
            "The flat design also opens up the possibility of more exercise. In addition to normal use to tone your abs and arms, you can also step it under your feet to work your leg muscles and your entire core.",
            "Thanks to its flat design, it folds up into a full cube that's easy to tuck under a bed, between a couch and a wall, or into any other crevice, and it's completely installation-free, so you can open the package and turn on the movement."

Don't let the cowardly name fool you, this challenging machine is a fundamental tool for improving lower body muscle mass. While standing squats are one of the most underrated and easily neglected exercises, this machine helps athletes to achieve the greatest possible results by performing them regularly. \nSissy squats work a variety of muscles, but none get more attention than the quadriceps. Accordingly, this exercise helps to balance your anterior and posterior chain muscles. The sissy squat machine helps to create an isolated environment where you can work the large muscles at the front of the thigh without overexerting your knees. \nSissy squat machine also helps to promote full body balance and improve your core strength."

            "Comprehensive Security - V squat machine provides a fixed motion trajectory, which can help to accurately control the body's posture and avoid injuries caused by wrong posture during free squat. The safety bar makes it easy to select the right height, making exercise more convenient and comfortable, and the design of the lowest lockout position reduces the risk of injury. The non-slip texture of the footboard increases friction and prevents displacement during exercise.",
            "Beyond the Traditional - Compared with traditional Hack Squat machines, the V Squat Machine provides greater stability and spreads the load more evenly throughout the lower limb muscle group to better balance the upper and middle leg joints. It is also more suitable for people with knee injuries while ensuring normal hip rotation within a natural range of motion.",
            "Durable Construction - This product features a durable heavy-duty frame design with outstanding stability and reliability. The frame is made of 2mm thick high-strength steel, carefully designed and manufactured to ensure that it can withstand heavy loads and long-term use without deformation or damage. And the rubber base pads provide thoughtful protection for the floor. Max Weight Capacity:1000LBS.",
            "Lower Extremity Strength Training - This innovative fitness equipment allows for easy targeting of the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves through a variety of exercises. It\u2019s the perfect choice for building leg strength, improving balance and stability, and sculpting a beautifully toned lower body."

            "Commercial Grade for Home Gym & Garage Gym Use: Strong hamstrings and quadriceps are crucial for balance, speed and coordination. You'll wish every day was leg day with LIONSCOOL Leg Machine. Unique cable and pulley system supplies consistent resistance throughout the motions, which differs from traditional lever operated machine and assists with the growth of stronger and more defined muscles. It can be used for seated leg extension and lying leg curl. Only seated leg curl is not applicable.",
            "Ultra Robust Structure with Rectangular Base and Extra Wide Foot Pads: The whole machine is constructed with 14-gauge tube and purpose built on a creative rectangular base to distribute pressure and eliminate rocking, ensuring an outstanding 400LBS weight plate loading capacity. And the weight capacity for users can reach up to 1000LBS. Each base foot has an enlarged stepped plate with a solid rubber covering, which increases stability further.",
            "Tough Cable and Pulley Handle Great Weights: The steel cable is 8mm thick and will last through grueling workouts. We specially design an adjustable bolt to regulate tension in case the cable stretches out over the years. The pulley with an enhanced steel core can withstand heavier loads and more intensive training. Plate loading post measures 12\u201d and fits 2-inch weight plates smoothly with its hard chrome plated surface.",
            "Extreme Convenient with Open Seat and Adjustable Pads: We discard the impractical knee holder to make getting in and off the machine effortless and smooth. 6 seat depth adjustable backrest will accommodate users of all heights. Our self-adjusting foot roller with its 7 angles adjustable arm will conform to your leg position freely and the seat is quickly adjustable by one pull pin between seated and prone positions.",
            "Innovative Seat Structure and Feel Comfort in Details: We have unique three-segment seat structure to maximize your comfort during your lying leg curls. The seat pad, middle pad and the backrest as well as the foam foot roller, are all 2.2\u201d thick with high density EPE foam, combining firm support with gentle feel. All cushions feature textured PU surface to ensure anti-slip performance. And two pairs of rubber grip handles located on both sides help assist body stability.",
            "Awesome Addition to Home Gym with Reliable Warranty: The assembled dimension is 45\u201d width x 56\u201d depth x 41\u201d height to fit into your home gym. We offer Manufacturer Limited Warranty: 2 years on framework (structural steel & welds) and 1 year on other parts. Assembly instructions and wrenches will come with the machine. It is surely a cost-effective investment of your fitness equipment. Please note that this machine comes in two packages and may not arrive at the same time."

        "features": [
            "[Compact for Limited Space] The LP10 leg press and hack squat machine, with dimensions of 67 inches (L) x 52 inches (W) x 47 inches (H) and a footprint of only 24.2 sq. m., offers efficient space utilization. Compared to other large combo machines, this machine can save almost 1/3 of the space. The installation manual and video guide you through the assembly quickly. The LP10 is ideal for limited spaces such as a garage or home gym.",
            "[Unique 30\u00b0Combo Machine] Unlike the common 45\u00b0leg press hack squat combo machine on the market, we offer a unique 30\u00b0positive angle. The relaxed 30\u00b0position enables better isolation of the quadriceps, and it\u2019s friendly for individuals with insufficient lower back strength and knee joint issues. Compared to traditional squat racks and barbells, it\u2019s generally considered safer and more user-friendly.",
            "[Pocket-Friendly] Save your wallet without compromising the effectiveness of your leg workout.",
            "[Full Range of Motion] Another great feature of the LP10 leg press hack squat combo machine is its full range of motion, which allows you to achieve deeper depth in your squats, even allowing for an ATG squat. Most 45\u00b0combo machines have a seat pad installed under the guide rail for users to get support while doing leg press, but this overall squat range is limited. In comparison, the LP10 is definitely a wise choice.",
            "[Easy Adjustable, Easy Organize] The backboard and foot pedals can be adjusted in 7 angles respectively to target different muscle groups. The shoulder pad used for assisting hack squats is removable and has 3 adjustable positions to accommodate people of different heights. We also added a storage area at the back of the product to keep your weight plates organized. The band pegs allow you to use resistance bands for resistance training.",
            "[Stable Construction] The LP10 has excellent stability and smooth performance. The steel tubes of the rails are 3mm thick and very robust. With a maximum weight capacity of 1000 lbs, it's solid and reliable. Our unique stop-loss device, featuring 1 solid stopper and 5 adjustable hole positions, ensures 100% injury prevention. Each stopper can handle a weight of up to 500 lbs."

            "This vertical leg press machine is made of 50 x 100 mm, 14 gauge high quality steel. Gross weight: 94 lbs. Weight capacity: 550lbs. User height: higher than 5.3''.",
            "Cost & Space Saving Choice: The GMWD vertical leg press machine is an excellent space saving machine. It's great for those who want to do leg press but don't have much space at home. Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad. Laying flat on the back pad, horizontally to the ground, your lower back, upper back, and neck, are almost completely left out of it. This can minimize lower back rounding and maintain your spine's natural curve. 5\u00b0Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising.",
            "Liner Bearing Design: Unlike other brands\u2019 nylon bushings or roller bearings, we updated liner bearings. \"Linear bearing\" means a higher cost for GMWD but a better feeling for you. You won't feel any clogged while you're exercising. Start your leg training more coherently and smoothly.",
            "3 start and end positions can meet the needs of people with different heights. Adjustable height range: 47.8'' to 62''. All your family members can enjoy the fun of leg strength training.",
            "This leg press machine has 3 weight posts to help you add weights to your training. The detachable sleeves can fit both 1'' & 2'' plates.",
            "Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising. Leaflike texture for better slip resistance."

            "Innovative Seat Structure and Feel Comfort in Details: We have unique three-segment seat structure to maximize your comfort during your lying leg curls. The seat pad, middle pad and the backrest as well as the foam foot roller, are all 2.2\u201d thick with high density EPE foam, combining firm support with gentle feel. All cushions feature textured PU surface to ensure anti-slip performance. And two pairs of rubber grip handles located on both sides help assist body stability.",
            "Awesome Addition to Home Gym with Reliable Warranty: The assembled dimension is 45\u201d width x 56\u201d depth x 41\u201d height to fit into your home gym.
