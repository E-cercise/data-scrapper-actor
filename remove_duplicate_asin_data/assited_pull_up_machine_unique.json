But you can\u2019t do it unless you are taking care of your body and working out. You can only work hard and play hard when you\u2019ve got an abundance of energy and vitality from eating health and working out. Pull-up is a great way to improve your workout. The problem is, Whether you are a fitness pros or a beginner, you will not be able to hold on for a long time when doing pull-ups, thus defeating the purpose of training, which will cause you to give up and continue to do pull-ups: The King of Upper Body Exercises. But YOKELE pull up resistance bands can perfectly solve this problem.",

            "2 in 1 Upper Body Training Machine: Perform back extensions and abdominal crunches from the same seated position. The rotary flywheel mechanism allows for complete control over your starting position. Replaced the installation of the limiters, a simple plug can be completed between the back extension and AB crunch mode conversion. Designed to save space and money by combining two commonly separate machines, into one compact, multi-function machine.",
            "Perfect Bottom Support: This AB back machine has 8 adjustable positions of foot restraints. Adjustable distance range: 31.4\u2018\u2019- 36.3\u2018\u2019. You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",
            "Adequate Back Support: The 2 inch padded cushion is made with a high quality leatherette surface that is easy to clean while guaranteeing comfort during your workout. The seat height also has five adjustable options, with an adjustable height range of 20.8''-24.7'', so don't worry about height being a limitation to your use of this upper body training equipment.",
            "Full Range Adjustable: Rotary flywheel mechanism and pop pin design allow for easy adjustment. 27 selectable holes that enable you to achieve over 180 degrees of adjustment. It allows for complete control over your starting position.",
            "Sculpt Core Muscles: The core acts as the center of your body and helps you utilize every other part of your body to maximum efficiency. Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."
