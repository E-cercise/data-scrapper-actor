Strengthening all pivot points and upgrading them with bearings instead of bushings to provide a powerfully smooth operation. Work out with no limits due to the unlimited resistance provided by air. Power your legs and arms faster or slower to determine your resistance. Monitor time, distance, calories, watts, RPMs, speed with the on board smart computer console. Includes Motivating programs, like Tabata Intervals, which help build up strength and stamina or choose the Heart Rate monitoring program to monitor your pulse and build up your aerobic base. All this is wrapped up in a frame that can take the abuse and dish it out too. Transport Handle and water bottle holder with water bottle included.",

        "description": "Tough ChoicesWork or exercise? Both activities are monumentally important, but sometimes we neglect the exercise part. Don't you wish you could do both at the same time? Well, we've got you covered, friend. The WIRK Ride Workstation lets you pedal your way to better health while keeping your productivity high. You can also push the desktop to the forward to convert to a standing desk.A Place to WorkThe work surface (17.25\"W x 10\"D) provides a great place to set your laptop or super-secret documents. Or, if tablets are your thing, simply prop it up on the handy-dandy adjustable tablet holder to the angle that works for you. The molded cup holder keeps your drink nice and safe from your occasional clumsiness (or is that just us at Stamina?). The desktop also includes molded handles and a fitness monitor that tracks time, speed, distance, calories, total distance. It even has a scan function so that you don't have to fixate yourself on one stat.A Place to RideThe WIRK Ride has its name for a reason. The adjustable magnetic tension exercise bike makes it easy to work your leg muscles and elevate your heart rate. It has a super comfy padded seat and backrest because we actually want you to use it! The seat height is adjustable to fit your ideal pedaling position.Standing RoomIt turns out that sitting all day isn't good for you. Even if you are pedaling! So, we've come up with a way to let you use the Ride as a Stand-Up workstation as well. The desktop easily pushes away from the seat by pushing up on the release with your foot and gently pushing away. Then, stand up and get your WIRK on!",

It's built to handle up to 2000 watts of power and can automatically adjust resistance based on the slope, mimicking slopes of up to 15% during challenging climbs.",
            "Work with Most Bike Models: The Sportneer Smart Bike Trainer is a perfect match for both road and mountain bikes, supporting wheel sizes of 26\", 28\", 29\", or 700c. It accommodates rear axle widths ranging from 3' to 6.37'. It's important to note that the trainer includes a quick release skewer, so if you have a thru-axle bike, you'll need to purchase an adapter separately.",

            "Note: Noise levels may vary depending on the type of bike tire tread - the more aggressive the tread, the louder the noise. Therefore, it's recommended for road bikes, and if you have a mountain bike with rough tires, please purchase with caution."

            "Versatile Compatibility: No more size problem! The Sportneer fluid resistance training stand fits various bike sizes, compatible with road or mountain bikes with 26-28\" or 700c wheels and rear wheel axles between 4.33' and 7.87'. (Note: This training stand only comes with a quick release skewer. For a thru-axle bike, you will need to purchase an adapter separately.)",
            "Near-silent Fluid Tech: It's absolutely frustrating to have your neighbor complaining about the thundering noise every time you practice. That's why this bike trainer comes with the built-in super noise reduction feature, eliminating noise and reduce friction for extended lifespan.",
            "Note: The noise level may vary depending on the tire tread pattern-the more the threads, the louder the noise. It's recommended to use a road bike or equip your bike with slick tires. If you have a mountain bike with rough tires and really mind the noise, buy it with caution.",
            "Stable & Safe Structure: Say goodbye to wobbles! Design with stability and safety in mind, we've crafted the triangular support structure from high-carbon steel and ABS, providing a sturdy and secure base for your bike. Better yet, The front wheel pad and adjustable rubber foot pads ensure that your bike stays in place, even on slightly uneven ground, allowing you to exercise with peace of mind.",
            "Indoor Cycling Available: Concerned about the challenges of riding in inclement weather, such as rain, snow, or icy/sunny road conditions? Luckily, the solution couldn't be simpler. With Sportneer fluid-resistant bike trainer, you can have the same outdoor experience when you can't practice outdoors. Now, your home is the unlimited cycling paradise.",
            "Ultra Compact Size: The Sportneer Fluid Indoor Bike Trainer can be assembled and disassembled in just a few short minutes. The frame can be folded to an ultra compact size (only 23*20*9.5 inches) for easier storage."
