        "description": "Product DescriptionPerform a variety of ab exercises easily, effectively, and safely with the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20). The adjustable, ergonomic AB crunch bench seat can be adjusted into 3 different positions to accommodate a wide range of heights and motion. The AB workout bench seat is angled at 45-degrees and reclines to 2 different 5-degree angles for a wide range of motion. This abdominal bench with adjustable length, textured grip handles, standard weight post, and 2-position footrests make it is comfortable and easy to perform exercises such as ab crunches and knee raises. When assembled the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20) measures 64 by 11 by 46 inches (L x W x H). The frame is backed by the Best Fitness 3-year Warranty and the parts are backed by a 1 year warranty.Amazon.comMake any time crunch time with the Best Fitness BFAB20 semi-recumbent ab crunch. Unlike some other ab machines--which require the agility of an acrobat to be thoroughly effective--the BFAB20 puts you in a comfortable seated position without sacrificing your workout efficiency. The ergonomically designed machine is built to help you tighten up your midsection, strengthen your back, and improve your core stability, with your choice of toning your lower abs with knees raises or your upper abs with abdominal crunches. To perform ab crunches, simply use the upholstered upper back support, textured grip handles, and standard weight post. Performing knee raises is just as easy thanks to the adjustable-length, two-position footrests. Add in a three-position upholstered seat--which starts at 45 degrees but offers two additional 5-degree reclining positions--and you have everything you need to design an effective ab regimen in the comfort of your own home.  The BFAB20 is an essential workout accessory because your core is where all your body movements originate. Your abdominal muscles support and protect your internal organs and aid in breathing, especially when you exhale. The abs also team up with your back muscles to control trunk motions, such as twisting and bending. The BFAB20 takes the next step by also strengthening and toning the front of the thighs and increasing hip flexibility. The end results include a flatter stomach, better defined abs, well-developed obliques, a more upright posture, and greater support for your spine. Other features include a 1.75-inch upholstered seat, a durable powder-coated finish, and safety pins and bolts that allow for easy disassembly or permanent setup. The BFAB20 measures 22 by 46 by 64 inches (W x H x D) and carries a three-year warranty.",

        "features": [
            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."

Machines generally provide a more controlled movement compared to free weights, reducing the risk of using improper form or cheating during the exercise.",
            "Ball Bearing Design: Our lateral raise machine is equipped with high-quality ball bearings inside the grip to provide frictionless rotation of the handle, ensuring a smooth and seamless moving experience. The smooth process facilitated by the ball bearings ensures a consistent and controlled motion, reducing strain on the wrists, forearms, and shoulders. The use of ball bearings in the grip handles also improves the durability and longevity of the machine."

This way your hydraulics will stay in outstanding condition for much longer. \nDo the hydraulics on the exerciser leak oil during training? \nAbsolutely not. The premium hydraulics built into the ShredForce are durable and made to feel absolutely outstanding during workouts - no leaks, no other issues. \nWho can benefit from the ShredForce? \nThe compact form combined with a wide resistance range makes the ShredForce a great option for traveling athletes, people just getting back into training, folks who live in smaller spaces, and anyone who needs an extra boost of upper body strength. \nWill the ShredForce replace my dumbbells? \nWhile most people will be perfectly satisfied with the upper body workouts they can perform with the Shredforce, it isn't made to be a direct replacement for dumbbells, but rather a complement that covers the needs your dumbbells don't. \nComparison Table \n\t\nShredForce \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast Lite \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer Lite \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n231 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n392 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\nPrice \n\t$38.24$38.24 \t$119.99$119.99 \t$144.49$144.49 \t$76.49$76.49 \t$118.99$118.99 \t\nIntended Use \n\tUpper Body \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes, Hips, Core, Hamstrings \tWhole Body \t\nWeight Capacity \n\tN/A \t265 lbs \t220 lbs \t330 lbs \t330 lbs \t\nComfortable Padding \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nFoldable \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nDimensions Unfolded \n\tFolded: 16.93\u201d \u00d7 6.30\u201d \u00d7 1.97\" \t43.3\u201d L x 22.5\" W x 19.7\" H \t50.6'' L x 19.7'' W x 19.2'' H \t38.8'' L x 22'' W x 27--34'' H \t35.4\" x 16.5\" x 28.0\" x 39.8\" \t\nIncludes Exercise Chart \n\t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\nAdjustable Height \n\t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nSpecial Features \n\t22- 440 lbs Resistance \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014",

            "2 in 1 Upper Body Training Machine: Perform back extensions and abdominal crunches from the same seated position. The rotary flywheel mechanism allows for complete control over your starting position. Replaced the installation of the limiters, a simple plug can be completed between the back extension and AB crunch mode conversion. Designed to save space and money by combining two commonly separate machines, into one compact, multi-function machine.",
            "Perfect Bottom Support: This AB back machine has 8 adjustable positions of foot restraints. Adjustable distance range: 31.4\u2018\u2019- 36.3\u2018\u2019. You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",
            "Adequate Back Support: The 2 inch padded cushion is made with a high quality leatherette surface that is easy to clean while guaranteeing comfort during your workout. The seat height also has five adjustable options, with an adjustable height range of 20.8''-24.7'', so don't worry about height being a limitation to your use of this upper body training equipment.",
            "Full Range Adjustable: Rotary flywheel mechanism and pop pin design allow for easy adjustment. 27 selectable holes that enable you to achieve over 180 degrees of adjustment. It allows for complete control over your starting position.",
            "Sculpt Core Muscles: The core acts as the center of your body and helps you utilize every other part of your body to maximum efficiency. Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."

            "HEAVY DUTY BACK ROW MACHINE: It is constructed with 2\"x 2\" 12-gauge steel for strength and durability, and high-density dual-layered padding to last through your most intense back workout. Rubber end caps on each foot of the Row Machine provide additional stability to the frame and prevent damage to your home gym floor.",
            "INDEPENDENT ARMS: Each arm on this seated row back pull machine works independently of each other. This gives you the option to work both sides of your back at the same time or in an alternating manner. Either way, this allows you to focus on each side of your back (without one side doing the bulk of the work), so you can strengthen each side of your back muscles including the lat muscles and spinal erectors, as well as your biceps as a secondary target",
            "VERSATILE GRIPS: This workout machine includes a stationary grip handle that allows you to target your back muscles like a T Row T Bar Row Machine, as well as a rotating grip handle. The rotating grip handle allows you to pivot your arm naturally during the row for a more comfortable movement/workout with less strain on your elbows",
            "ADJUSTABLE: The seat pad adjusts in 4 positions vertically to find the right height for you during your workout, while the chest pad adjusts in 5 different positions. The seat is tapered for a comfortable and natural position during your row workout.",
            "PLATE LOADED- It can hold both standard and Olympic sized weights or bumper weight plates. Purchase includes 2 Olympic sleeve adapters, and both Olympic and standard sized spring clips",
            "ADDITIONAL: The seated row and pull machine is perfect for athletes of all levels, in any home gym or light-commercial fitness center. Max weight load of 200 lb per arm - 400 lb total max weight load"

            "This vertical leg press machine is made of 50 x 100 mm, 14 gauge high quality steel. Gross weight: 94 lbs. Weight capacity: 550lbs. User height: higher than 5.3''.",
            "Cost & Space Saving Choice: The GMWD vertical leg press machine is an excellent space saving machine. It's great for those who want to do leg press but don't have much space at home. Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad. Laying flat on the back pad, horizontally to the ground, your lower back, upper back, and neck, are almost completely left out of it. This can minimize lower back rounding and maintain your spine's natural curve. 5\u00b0Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising.",
            "Liner Bearing Design: Unlike other brands\u2019 nylon bushings or roller bearings, we updated liner bearings. \"Linear bearing\" means a higher cost for GMWD but a better feeling for you. You won't feel any clogged while you're exercising. Start your leg training more coherently and smoothly.",
            "3 start and end positions can meet the needs of people with different heights. Adjustable height range: 47.8'' to 62''. All your family members can enjoy the fun of leg strength training.",
            "This leg press machine has 3 weight posts to help you add weights to your training. The detachable sleeves can fit both 1'' & 2'' plates.",
            "Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising. Leaflike texture for better slip resistance."

            "\u3010Stability & Versatile Workout\u3011This two-in-one leg press and hack squat machine, red model, adopts linear bearings rather than rolling ones, and it is constructed of heavy-duty high tensile beefy steel. Beyond that, there are two weight plate storage holders at the rear bottom, when stacked up, greatly enhance machine's stability when in motion. By adjusting the placement of your feet on the foot plate, you can focus more on training isolating muscle groups.",
            "\u3010Multiple Adjustments\u3011As a well-crafted design, there are 5 angle choices for hack squat and 3 for leg press setting, accomodating different sized athelets. The side rail (safety catches attached) handles can be pushed out to unlock the sled. After you are done with your set, pull both handles inward yourself to lock the sled in your designated lockout position. With a quick flip of the back pad and lowering of the leg press footplate, you can switch workouts in seconds to perform hack squat.",
            "\u3010Comfort & Smooth Exercise Experience\u3011This leg press and hack squat gym machine features thick shoulder and backrest cushion wrapped in premium anti-slip and wear-resistant leather surface, providing ultimate and long-lasting comfort to ease your strain and stress, and protecting your bones and joints during your bodybuilding. Solid metal guide rods (sled) and aluminium alloy grips on both sides upgrade your workout experience without jerk motions.",
            "\u3010Safety & Considerate Design\u3011The weight carriage fits 2'' plates, and Max 1200 lbs plate loading satisfies most users' needs. It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use. Two cushionings at the sled's bottom soften sudden impact with less noise. The triangular piece at the base of the back support also enhances overall stability.",
            "\u3010Separate Package\u3011Our leg press and hack squat machine will be shipped in two separate packages to minimize the possibility of wear and tear due to collisions. Your packages may arrive on different dates. If you only receive part of the shipment, please be patient as we continuously monitor your logistics status. Backed by RitFit Lifetime Limited Warranty and friendly customer service, buy with confidence in RitFit!"

            "My name is Jennifer, and this is my first month using my cable machine home gym. As a busy professional, I've always wanted to be able to work out my whole body at home\u2014not just by running or doing simple yoga routines. So, I began searching for gym equipment that could meet all my full-body training needs.",
            "After careful comparison, I finally decided on this multi-functional fitness equipment, primarily because of its wide range of workout options and customizable adjustment features. First, it\u2019s equipped with 13 weight pieces totaling 143 pounds, with adjustable weights that suit not only me but also my husband and family, meeting various fitness levels.",
            "With this gym equipment, I do chest flys, leg training, pull-ups, low rows, chest presses, shoulder presses, leg extensions, and more. It allows me to comprehensively train my chest, back, legs, and even smaller muscles like abs and calves. It really covers everything, helping me achieve the results I want.",
            "My family and I particularly appreciate the flexibility of this functional trainer. For instance, the butterfly arms can be adjusted to three levels, the leg press has adjustable height and forward-backward options, and the seat cushion can be set at four levels, providing a different support experience every time and making each workout comfortable and natural.",
            "I also found that the L-shaped steel butterfly arm structure makes the setup very stable. The seat cushion is made from soft materials, so even during long workouts, it\u2019s still comfortable. Most notably, the leg support and curl pad are detachable, so we can store them when not in use to save space. The pulley system of lat pulldown machines is specially designed to operate smoothly and quietly, so I don\u2019t have to worry about disturbing my family.",
            "A few days after buying it, I received the four packages shipped separately. With the detailed installation manual and tools, my husband and I only took a few hours to set it up\u2014easy and convenient.",
            "Now, I work out on this all in one gym every day, and I can already feel significant changes in my body. My husband also loves it; we take turns using it daily and enjoy sharing the fun of working out and the health benefits together. I\u2019m so glad I chose this product. It not only provides a high-quality workout experience but also brings a positive, healthy activity into our home."

The high-density, dual-layered pad folds down for the incline bench feature and acts as an ab crunch board. The foam ankle pads secure the user and support ankles and knees when performing ab crunches. The safety catches allow each arm to be rested when not in use and protect the user in the event the lift cannot be completed. Each safety catch, featuring a protective rubber strip, has 9 different adjustment positions using a locking pin, allowing an 8\u201d range. A plate storage peg is featured on both sides of the unit to allow a clean and organized home gym. \nEach weight & storage peg measures 8\u201d long and 1\u201d in diameter. To convert plate storage pegs to 2\" for Olympic style plates, the EX-10 adaptor is sold separately. \nThis weight bench station has a Maximum Weight load of 125 lbs per arm, allowing users to train with up to 250 lbs. total. \nMaximize Your Home Gym Workout - Upper Body & Core Routines \nFlat Bench- Chest Press \nFlat bench presses are best for overall development of the pectoralis, commonly known as the pecs or your chest muscles.

All the way through the movement from push-up through the peak contraction, your body is stable with no damaging rotation of the wrists or shoulder joints. \nAre the resistance bands adjustable or universal? \nThe resistance bands of the Iron Chest Master are adjustable -- resistance ranging from 60 lbs to 120+ lbs. Resistance bands can be individually substituted in order to customize the resistance level of the machine to suit the individual user. \nWhat are the dimensions and weight? \nIron Chest Master is 48\" x 6\" x 4\" and the weight is 7 lbs. \nHow much weight can it hold? \nThe bearings on the machine can hold up to 300 lbs. per handle, so a total of 600 lbs. of pressure. It would be almost impossible to place that type of stress on the machine. \n\t\nIron Chest Master Beginner \nIron Chest Master Intermediate \nIron Chest Master Extreme \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.5 out of 5 stars \n2,051 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n2,051 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n2,051 \n\t\nPrice $99.00$99.00 \t$109.95$109.95 \t$119.95$119.95 \t\nFitness Level Beginner \tIntermediate \tExpert \t\nResistance Level Range 0-65 lbs \t0-120 lbs \t0-180 lbs \t\nNutrition Guidance by Coach Ron \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\nOnline Training Program by Coach Ron \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\n6 Standard Replacement Bands \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\n6 Pro Replacement Bands \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\n60 lbs Chest Strap \t\t\u2713",
