The number of reps you should do in each set depends on your current strength level. Continue performing reps until you reach fatigue. \nDo slow and controlled reps. Alternatively, you can hold the Python in its compressed position until exhaustion. Incorporate the power twister exercise at the end of your upper-body or chest workouts so that your chest and arms aren\u2019t fatigued when performing other exercises.",

            "This vertical leg press machine is made of 50 x 100 mm, 14 gauge high quality steel. Gross weight: 94 lbs. Weight capacity: 550lbs. User height: higher than 5.3''.",
            "Cost & Space Saving Choice: The GMWD vertical leg press machine is an excellent space saving machine. It's great for those who want to do leg press but don't have much space at home. Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad. Laying flat on the back pad, horizontally to the ground, your lower back, upper back, and neck, are almost completely left out of it. This can minimize lower back rounding and maintain your spine's natural curve. 5\u00b0Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising.",
            "Liner Bearing Design: Unlike other brands\u2019 nylon bushings or roller bearings, we updated liner bearings. \"Linear bearing\" means a higher cost for GMWD but a better feeling for you. You won't feel any clogged while you're exercising. Start your leg training more coherently and smoothly.",
            "3 start and end positions can meet the needs of people with different heights. Adjustable height range: 47.8'' to 62''. All your family members can enjoy the fun of leg strength training.",
            "This leg press machine has 3 weight posts to help you add weights to your training. The detachable sleeves can fit both 1'' & 2'' plates.",
            "Tilted and enlarged footboard is ergonomic and can be more comfortable while you are exercising. Leaflike texture for better slip resistance."

This way your hydraulics will stay in outstanding condition for much longer. \nDo the hydraulics on the exerciser leak oil during training? \nAbsolutely not. The premium hydraulics built into the ShredForce are durable and made to feel absolutely outstanding during workouts - no leaks, no other issues. \nWho can benefit from the ShredForce? \nThe compact form combined with a wide resistance range makes the ShredForce a great option for traveling athletes, people just getting back into training, folks who live in smaller spaces, and anyone who needs an extra boost of upper body strength. \nWill the ShredForce replace my dumbbells? \nWhile most people will be perfectly satisfied with the upper body workouts they can perform with the Shredforce, it isn't made to be a direct replacement for dumbbells, but rather a complement that covers the needs your dumbbells don't. \nComparison Table \n\t\nShredForce \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast Lite \nAdd to Cart \nGluteBlast \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer Lite \nAdd to Cart \nSculptTrainer \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n230 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n390 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n390 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n599 \n\t\nPrice \n\t$38.24$38.24 \t$119.99$119.99 \t$144.49$144.49 \t$76.49$76.49 \t$118.99$118.99 \t\nIntended Use \n\tUpper Body \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes & Hips \tGlutes, Hips, Core, Hamstrings \tWhole Body \t\nWeight Capacity \n\tN/A \t265 lbs \t220 lbs \t330 lbs \t330 lbs \t\nComfortable Padding \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nFoldable \n\t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nDimensions Unfolded \n\tFolded: 16.93\u201d \u00d7 6.30\u201d \u00d7 1.97\" \t43.3\u201d L x 22.5\" W x 19.7\" H \t50.6'' L x 19.7'' W x 19.2'' H \t38.8'' L x 22'' W x 27--34'' H \t35.4\" x 16.5\" x 28.0\" x 39.8\" \t\nIncludes Exercise Chart \n\t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\nAdjustable Height \n\t\u2718 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\u2714 \t\nSpecial Features \n\t22- 440 lbs Resistance \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014 \t\u2014",

Large, cushioned seating and knee pad provide exceptional comfort and support. \nDUAL SAFETY STRAPS \n2 pairs of safety straps located on the front post of the stretch machine will help ensure the safe operation of the stretch trainer machine. \nINSTRUCTIONAL PLACARD \nDetailed instructions for 9 different stretches help you get started on your stretching regimen. \nSELF-LEVELING PEDALS \nNever lose your step and recover quickly for your next stretch position. \nMULTI-GRIP HANDLES \nSwitch grips to assist in targeting and focusing on specific areas or positions. \nFOAM ROLLERS \nKick your feet up, decompress, and stretch using the padded foam rollers. \nHAMSTRING \nHold the ropes or lower handlebar with the palms facing down. Extend one leg up, placing your foot on the foam pad straightening your leg. To intensify the stretch in your hamstring, keep your chest open, and reach for the upper handlebar, switch sides. \nQUADRICEPS \nStand at the front of your machine, facing away from your machine. Bring one foot up, resting your toes on the foam pad. Press into the stretch on the front side of your leg. Use the upper handlebar for balance. Keep your body neutral, switch sides. \nLOWER BACK \nStart with the seat in its forward position, holding the upper handlebar or ropes with palms facing down. Sink your weight into the seat, allowing gravity to pull you slowly deeper into a lower back stretch. \nUPPER BACK \nHold ropes or upper handlebar with palms facing upward. Allow gravity to slowly tilt the seat back. To target the different areas of your upper back and neck slowly roll your head to the right, left, and down, or up, pausing where it feels good. \nINNER THIGHS, GROIN \nHold the ropes or the lower handlebar with palms facing down. With seat forward, place soles of your feet together, resting on the lower pad and pressing knees out. Slowly tilt the seat back, lengthening the upper body to deepen the stretch. \nHAMSTRING, IT BAND, HIPS, BACK \nHold the right side of the ropes or lower handlebar with palms facing down.

            "CHEST PRESS MACHINE PLATE LOADED - Gronk Fitness Seated Chest Press is the ultimate secret weapon if you're serious about building a strong and powerful chest. This beast of a machine is designed to target your pectoral muscles with precision, giving you that chiseled and well-defined chest you've always desired. With adjustable resistance and a comfortable seat, you can push your limits while maintaining proper form",
            "CHEST MACHINE HOME GYM - The seated chest press machine eliminates the need for stabilizing muscles, which are necessary for maintaining balance during a bench press. This results in a focus solely on the chest muscles rather than engaging those that assist in pressing movements, which may not align with functional fitness goals. Place up to 220lbs on each weight horn with standard 2-inch olympic plates",
            "PERFECT FOR HOME OR COMMERCIAL GYM - Compact machine for home gyms, commercial gyms or smaller workout spaces",
            "BENEFITS - This machine targets the pectorals, the main muscles of the chest. The same muscles you use when pushing a grocery cart or to get up off the floor. The chest press machine also recruits the biceps and the big muscles of the shoulders and back. That makes this exercise especially beneficial for those who participate in sports that involve the swinging of a bat, racket or golf club",
            "BUILD GREATNESS - Get ready to redefine your fitness journey with Gronk Fitness. Join the movement and experience the difference with Gronk Fitness \u2013 where power meets precision, and every workout propels you closer to your fitness aspirations"

Machines generally provide a more controlled movement compared to free weights, reducing the risk of using improper form or cheating during the exercise.",
            "Ball Bearing Design: Our lateral raise machine is equipped with high-quality ball bearings inside the grip to provide frictionless rotation of the handle, ensuring a smooth and seamless moving experience. The smooth process facilitated by the ball bearings ensures a consistent and controlled motion, reducing strain on the wrists, forearms, and shoulders. The use of ball bearings in the grip handles also improves the durability and longevity of the machine."

            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."

            "2 in 1 Upper Body Training Machine: Perform back extensions and abdominal crunches from the same seated position. The rotary flywheel mechanism allows for complete control over your starting position. Replaced the installation of the limiters, a simple plug can be completed between the back extension and AB crunch mode conversion. Designed to save space and money by combining two commonly separate machines, into one compact, multi-function machine.",
            "Perfect Bottom Support: This AB back machine has 8 adjustable positions of foot restraints. Adjustable distance range: 31.4\u2018\u2019- 36.3\u2018\u2019. You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",
            "Adequate Back Support: The 2 inch padded cushion is made with a high quality leatherette surface that is easy to clean while guaranteeing comfort during your workout. The seat height also has five adjustable options, with an adjustable height range of 20.8''-24.7'', so don't worry about height being a limitation to your use of this upper body training equipment.",
            "Full Range Adjustable: Rotary flywheel mechanism and pop pin design allow for easy adjustment. 27 selectable holes that enable you to achieve over 180 degrees of adjustment. It allows for complete control over your starting position.",
            "Sculpt Core Muscles: The core acts as the center of your body and helps you utilize every other part of your body to maximum efficiency. Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."

            "\u3010Stability & Versatile Workout\u3011This two-in-one leg press and hack squat machine, red model, adopts linear bearings rather than rolling ones, and it is constructed of heavy-duty high tensile beefy steel. Beyond that, there are two weight plate storage holders at the rear bottom, when stacked up, greatly enhance machine's stability when in motion. By adjusting the placement of your feet on the foot plate, you can focus more on training isolating muscle groups.",
            "\u3010Multiple Adjustments\u3011As a well-crafted design, there are 5 angle choices for hack squat and 3 for leg press setting, accomodating different sized athelets. The side rail (safety catches attached) handles can be pushed out to unlock the sled. After you are done with your set, pull both handles inward yourself to lock the sled in your designated lockout position. With a quick flip of the back pad and lowering of the leg press footplate, you can switch workouts in seconds to perform hack squat.",
            "\u3010Comfort & Smooth Exercise Experience\u3011This leg press and hack squat gym machine features thick shoulder and backrest cushion wrapped in premium anti-slip and wear-resistant leather surface, providing ultimate and long-lasting comfort to ease your strain and stress, and protecting your bones and joints during your bodybuilding. Solid metal guide rods (sled) and aluminium alloy grips on both sides upgrade your workout experience without jerk motions.",
            "\u3010Safety & Considerate Design\u3011The weight carriage fits 2'' plates, and Max 1200 lbs plate loading satisfies most users' needs. It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use. Two cushionings at the sled's bottom soften sudden impact with less noise. The triangular piece at the base of the back support also enhances overall stability.",
            "\u3010Separate Package\u3011Our leg press and hack squat machine will be shipped in two separate packages to minimize the possibility of wear and tear due to collisions. Your packages may arrive on different dates. If you only receive part of the shipment, please be patient as we continuously monitor your logistics status. Backed by RitFit Lifetime Limited Warranty and friendly customer service, buy with confidence in RitFit!"

            "[Versatile Upper Body Training Machine]- The seated triceps dip machine allows for focused and isolated workouts. Its convergent motion ensures that the triceps muscles are activated for maximum exercise effectiveness. In addition, the triceps press machine comes with a cable bar for doing biceps exercises like upright cable rows and biceps curls. It's a versatile machine that engages the muscles of the arms, shoulder and chest to take your upper body strength training to the next level!",
            "[Improved Arms and Machine Design]- The seated dip machine is a safer and more effective alternative to traditional tricep dips, which can cause strain on the wrists and shoulders. With stable and controllable movements, this seated dip station minimizes the risk of injuries. Additionally, the tricep pushdown machine features a rotating handle that can be adjusted to fit varying shoulder widths, providing multiple grip options to target different areas of the triceps muscles.",
            "[Personalized Adjustments]- It offers easy-to-use personalization adjustments, allowing you to customize your workout to suit your varying fitness levels and training goals with simple weight plate adjustments. Even beginners can experience challenging workouts without requiring extensive technical skills or coordination. The seat height and cable bar length can be adjusted to accommodate different body types, ensuring maximum comfort and efficiency during your exercise routine.",
            "[High Quality Material]- The plate loaded tricep machine is composed of heavy-duty steel and premium coatings, making it durable and stable. The comfortable, sweat-resistant seat and backrest provide ample support for intense workouts and long-term use. Measuring only 42.7\"x26.2\"x51.2\", it's the ideal size for any space in your home gym. With a maximum weight capacity of 400 LBS and compatibility with 1\" and 2\" weight plates, it can meet your most daily training needs. (Plates are not included)",
            "[Easy to Use Step]- The tricep press machine is also featured by simplicity in use. To give your triceps a serious workout, all you need to do is choose the right weights, adjust the seat height, and grab onto the narrow handles. If you want to give your lower chest muscles some extra attention, just lean forward ever so slightly and switch to the wide handle. To perform a bicep curl, rise to your feet and plant them firmly on a rugged steel plate, then you can exercise freely with cable handle."
