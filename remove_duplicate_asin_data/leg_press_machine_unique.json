LP05 equips a 19*22'' big footboard and you can do all leg core muscle exercise on it. \nReason2:Why \"LP05 Leg press machine\" not \"Press and Hack squat combo machine\"? \nLet's do the math. LP05 equips 4x 10'' long weight pins for loading. Other combo machine only equips 2 weight pins. For leg training, you can have more weight options. \nReason3:Why \"LP05 Leg press machine\" not \"Press and Hack squat combo machine\"? \nThe aim muscles of the leg press and hack squat are similar. If you get combo machine, you are spending more budget and get repeated function. Why don't you buy a large footboard and heavier weight rating machine for your leg day and save your money? \nPrevious page\nNext page\n1 HEIGHT CHOICE 2 ADJUSTABLE BOARD 3 SAFETY LIMITER 4 ADJUSTABLE BAND PEG 5 FIT ALL WEIGHTS \nPrevious page\nNext page",

Assemble size: 43.5\u2019\u2019 x 32.5\u2019\u2019 x 62\u2019\u2019. 50% less footprint than the normal 45\u00b0leg press machine. The full 1:1 ratio means that you don't need many weights, which is also a cost saving choice.",
            "Ergonomic design: This leg machine has 3 positions backrest pad and head pad.

            "\u3010Stability & Versatile Workout\u3011This two-in-one leg press and hack squat machine, red model, adopts linear bearings rather than rolling ones, and it is constructed of heavy-duty high tensile beefy steel. Beyond that, there are two weight plate storage holders at the rear bottom, when stacked up, greatly enhance machine's stability when in motion. By adjusting the placement of your feet on the foot plate, you can focus more on training isolating muscle groups.",
            "\u3010Multiple Adjustments\u3011As a well-crafted design, there are 5 angle choices for hack squat and 3 for leg press setting, accomodating different sized athelets. The side rail (safety catches attached) handles can be pushed out to unlock the sled. After you are done with your set, pull both handles inward yourself to lock the sled in your designated lockout position. With a quick flip of the back pad and lowering of the leg press footplate, you can switch workouts in seconds to perform hack squat.",
            "\u3010Comfort & Smooth Exercise Experience\u3011This leg press and hack squat gym machine features thick shoulder and backrest cushion wrapped in premium anti-slip and wear-resistant leather surface, providing ultimate and long-lasting comfort to ease your strain and stress, and protecting your bones and joints during your bodybuilding. Solid metal guide rods (sled) and aluminium alloy grips on both sides upgrade your workout experience without jerk motions.",
            "\u3010Safety & Considerate Design\u3011The weight carriage fits 2'' plates, and Max 1200 lbs plate loading satisfies most users' needs. It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use. Two cushionings at the sled's bottom soften sudden impact with less noise. The triangular piece at the base of the back support also enhances overall stability.",
            "\u3010Separate Package\u3011Our leg press and hack squat machine will be shipped in two separate packages to minimize the possibility of wear and tear due to collisions. Your packages may arrive on different dates. If you only receive part of the shipment, please be patient as we continuously monitor your logistics status. Backed by RitFit Lifetime Limited Warranty and friendly customer service, buy with confidence in RitFit!"

It is beginner-friendly, for experienced pro, you can do one leg at a time. Large diamond-plated footplate increases friction, preventing accidental sideslipping while in use.

        "features": [
            "[Compact for Limited Space] The LP10 leg press and hack squat machine, with dimensions of 67 inches (L) x 52 inches (W) x 47 inches (H) and a footprint of only 24.2 sq. m., offers efficient space utilization. Compared to other large combo machines, this machine can save almost 1/3 of the space. The installation manual and video guide you through the assembly quickly. The LP10 is ideal for limited spaces such as a garage or home gym.",
            "[Unique 30\u00b0Combo Machine] Unlike the common 45\u00b0leg press hack squat combo machine on the market, we offer a unique 30\u00b0positive angle. The relaxed 30\u00b0position enables better isolation of the quadriceps, and it\u2019s friendly for individuals with insufficient lower back strength and knee joint issues. Compared to traditional squat racks and barbells, it\u2019s generally considered safer and more user-friendly.",
            "[Pocket-Friendly] Save your wallet without compromising the effectiveness of your leg workout.",
            "[Full Range of Motion] Another great feature of the LP10 leg press hack squat combo machine is its full range of motion, which allows you to achieve deeper depth in your squats, even allowing for an ATG squat. Most 45\u00b0combo machines have a seat pad installed under the guide rail for users to get support while doing leg press, but this overall squat range is limited. In comparison, the LP10 is definitely a wise choice.",
            "[Easy Adjustable, Easy Organize] The backboard and foot pedals can be adjusted in 7 angles respectively to target different muscle groups. The shoulder pad used for assisting hack squats is removable and has 3 adjustable positions to accommodate people of different heights. We also added a storage area at the back of the product to keep your weight plates organized. The band pegs allow you to use resistance bands for resistance training.",
            "[Stable Construction] The LP10 has excellent stability and smooth performance. The steel tubes of the rails are 3mm thick and very robust. With a maximum weight capacity of 1000 lbs, it's solid and reliable. Our unique stop-loss device, featuring 1 solid stopper and 5 adjustable hole positions, ensures 100% injury prevention. Each stopper can handle a weight of up to 500 lbs."

            "rawText": "Product Description\nBells of Steel Belt Squat Machine \nThe Bells of Steel Belt Squat Machine is the best belt squat machine out there and is available with new upgrades. With our belt squat machine, you can train your legs without overworking your spine and torso, thus preventing injuries and aches so you can continue to work on your fitness goals. \nPAIN-FREE TRAINING \nLeg presses put pressure on your torso, so taking off that weight gives your torso a break. Our machine is suitable for those with upper-body injuries with superior bushings on the pivot points for smoother movements. The Bells of Steel Belt Squat machine removes stress on your upper body, more importantly, your spine, which will allow you to train solely on your lower body. \nINNOVATIVE DESIGN \nOur Belt Squat machine measures 51 inches long, 52 inches wide, 40 inches tall, and 35.5 inches wide for the base. We\u2019ve included a heavy-duty belt with two feet of chain and two carabiners. There are optional side or top loaded pegs and four adjustable band pegs for additional dynamic resistance. \nMULTI-PURPOSE WITH GREAT VALUE \nThe Bells of Steel belt squat machine allows you to perform exercises other than belt squats, including belt marches, lunges, tricep extensions, high pulls, deadlifts, and more. Our machine emphasizes hip extension, ensuring your glutes will be at their strongest. With a weight capacity of 700 pounds, you can get the most out of your workout with this one single machine. \n\t\nArm Blaster \nFractional Weight Plates \nGlute Ham Glider \nMighty Plates \nPlyometric Jump Box \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nBuying Options \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.2 out of 5 stars \n150 \n\t\n4.7 out of 5 stars \n157 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n87 \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n96 \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n62 \n\t\nPrice $39.99$39.99 \t$36.79$36.79 \t$89.99$89.99 \t\u2014 \t$139.99$139.99 \t\nMuscle Group Biceps, triceps, elbows \tFull body \tHamstrings, glutes, lower back \tFull body \tGlutes, quads, hamstrings, claves, chest, triceps, biceps, abs \t\nMovement Bicep curls \tAll movements \tHamstring curl, front roll-out, standing lunges \tAll movements \tBox jumps, step ups, push ups, tricep dips \t\nAttribute Target and isolate biceps \tMicro-loading for less plateaus \tPosterior chain pulverizer \tErgonomic handles for easy plate loading \tTraining plyometric agility",

            "\u3010Stability & Versatile Workout\u3011This pink two-in-one leg press and hack squat machine features linear bearings and is built with high tensile, heavy-duty steel. The two rear weight plate storage holders enhance stability during use. Adjust your foot placement on the footplate to better isolate and train specific muscle groups. This pink model is especially popular among female customers.",
            "\u3010Multiple Adjustments\u3011Featuring a well-crafted design, this machine offers 5 angle options for hack squat and 3 for leg press settings, accommodating athletes of different sizes. The side rail safety catches can be pushed out to unlock the sled and pulled inward to lock it in place after your set. Switch between workouts in seconds by quickly flipping the back pad and lowering the leg press footplate, allowing you to perform hack squats seamlessly.",
            "\u3010Comfort & Smooth Exercise Experience\u3011This leg press and hack squat gym machine includes thick shoulder and backrest cushions wrapped in premium, anti-slip, and wear-resistant leather, providing ultimate comfort to reduce strain and protect your joints and bones. The solid metal guide rods and aluminum alloy grips on both sides enhance your workout experience by eliminating jerk motions.",
            "\u3010Safety & Considerate Design\u3011The weight carriage is compatible with 2'' plates and supports a maximum load of 1200 lbs, meeting the needs of most users. Beginner-friendly and suitable for pros who prefer single-leg exercises, the large diamond-plated footplate increases friction and prevents accidental slipping. Cushions at the sled's bottom soften impacts and reduce noise, while the triangular piece at the base of the back support enhances overall stability.",

        "description": "Leg presses are a popular exercise in the realm of strength training and bodybuilding for several reasons. They offer a range of benefits that contribute to a well-rounded lower body workout and overall fitness. Here's why people incorporate leg presses into their exercise routines: Muscle Development - Leg presses primarily target the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps (front thigh muscles), hamstrings (back thigh muscles), glutes (buttocks), and calves. By performing leg presses, individuals can effectively develop and strengthen these muscles, leading to improved leg aesthetics and functionality. Isolation and Control - Leg presses allow for controlled and guided movements, minimizing the risk of injury due to poor form. This exercise isolates the lower body muscles, making it easier to focus on specific muscle groups and achieve better results. Variety and Customization - Leg press machines come with adjustable resistance, enabling users to customize the weight according to their fitness level and goals. This flexibility makes leg presses suitable for individuals of all experience levels, from beginners to advanced lifters. Lower Back Safety - Unlike some other leg exercises like squats, leg presses place less strain on the lower back. This makes them a preferred option for people with lower back issues or those looking to target their leg muscles without putting excessive stress on their back. Functional Strength - Strong leg muscles are essential for everyday activities such as walking, running, climbing stairs, and lifting objects. Leg presses help enhance lower body strength, improving overall functional fitness. Reduced Joint Impact - Leg presses are a lower-impact exercise compared to exercises like running or jumping, making them suitable for individuals with joint concerns or those recovering from injuries.",

            "rawText": "Product Description\nWith the Synergee Leg Press Machine, you\u2019ll never want to skip leg day again! Get those quad and glute gains with leg presses you can load up to 400 lbs. But the Synergee Leg Press Machine doesn\u2019t stop there: with a few adjustments, your leg press machine can turn into a lat pull down machine. Double the functionality for double the gains. \nThe Synergee Leg Press Machine sits on a 68\u201d x 24\u201d base and 63\u201d high. It is compatible with 1\u201d- and 2\u201d-opening weight plates, thanks to the adaptable loading arms. It is equipped with a 10\u201d x 12\u201d padded seat and a 24\u201dx 12\u201d padded back rest to provide a comfortable workout. \nTo keep you safe during your reps, this press machine has a brake to keep the weight suspended until you\u2019re ready to lift. And once you\u2019re ready, it\u2019s easy to flip down and get pressing. As well, this machine comes equipped with a lat pull down bar that easily clips into the pulley system. Lower and upper body machine, all rolled into one? \nFULL BODY EXERCISE MACHINE \nEven if you\u2019re home gym is tight on space, it doesn\u2019t have to be tight on functionality. The Synerge Leg Press machine has the capacity to provide leg presses AND lat pull down exercises. We didn\u2019t want you to have to choose between an upper body and a lower body machine: we decided to give you both! \nSAFETY FIRST \nPerform your leg presses safely with the built-in brake. Set the leg press on the brake in the upright position when you\u2019re done your reps and when you\u2019re loading up the machine; get yourself into position; brace your feet against the foot platform; then flip the brake down and get lifting. \nCOMPACT DESIGN, BIG GAINS \nThis machine takes up an 68\u201d x 24\u201d rectangle of floor space; but it provides an entire upper and lower body burn! We\u2019ve made it compact to fit most home gyms \u2013 and to keep it from taking away space from your other equipment! \u2013 and turned the functionality way up to make every inch of it count. \nTEXTURED PRESS PLATFORM \nWhen you press those weights against the foot platform, you\u2019ll feel confident and grounded. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve designed the foot platforms with a textured surface for some extra grit and friction. Feel secure while you\u2019re getting strong. \nCOMFORTABLE HEAD REST \nWhether you\u2019re leg pressing or lat pulling, the last thing you need is a cramping neck. We took that out of the equation with a padded, rolling head and neck rest.

            "Comprehensive Security - V squat machine provides a fixed motion trajectory, which can help to accurately control the body's posture and avoid injuries caused by wrong posture during free squat. The safety bar makes it easy to select the right height, making exercise more convenient and comfortable, and the design of the lowest lockout position reduces the risk of injury. The non-slip texture of the footboard increases friction and prevents displacement during exercise.",
            "Beyond the Traditional - Compared with traditional Hack Squat machines, the V Squat Machine provides greater stability and spreads the load more evenly throughout the lower limb muscle group to better balance the upper and middle leg joints. It is also more suitable for people with knee injuries while ensuring normal hip rotation within a natural range of motion.",
            "Durable Construction - This product features a durable heavy-duty frame design with outstanding stability and reliability. The frame is made of 2mm thick high-strength steel, carefully designed and manufactured to ensure that it can withstand heavy loads and long-term use without deformation or damage. And the rubber base pads provide thoughtful protection for the floor. Max Weight Capacity:1000LBS.",
            "Lower Extremity Strength Training - This innovative fitness equipment allows for easy targeting of the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves through a variety of exercises. It\u2019s the perfect choice for building leg strength, improving balance and stability, and sculpting a beautifully toned lower body."
