All the way through the movement from push-up through the peak contraction, your body is stable with no damaging rotation of the wrists or shoulder joints. \nAre the resistance bands adjustable or universal? \nThe resistance bands of the Iron Chest Master are adjustable -- resistance ranging from 60 lbs to 120+ lbs. Resistance bands can be individually substituted in order to customize the resistance level of the machine to suit the individual user. \nWhat are the dimensions and weight? \nIron Chest Master is 48\" x 6\" x 4\" and the weight is 7 lbs. \nHow much weight can it hold? \nThe bearings on the machine can hold up to 300 lbs. per handle, so a total of 600 lbs. of pressure. It would be almost impossible to place that type of stress on the machine. \n\t\nIron Chest Master Beginner \nIron Chest Master Intermediate \nIron Chest Master Extreme \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nAdd to Cart \n\t\nCustomer Reviews \n4.5 out of 5 stars \n2,051 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n2,051 \n\t\n4.5 out of 5 stars \n2,051 \n\t\nPrice $99.00$99.00 \t$109.95$109.95 \t$119.95$119.95 \t\nFitness Level Beginner \tIntermediate \tExpert \t\nResistance Level Range 0-65 lbs \t0-120 lbs \t0-180 lbs \t\nNutrition Guidance by Coach Ron \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\nOnline Training Program by Coach Ron \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\n6 Standard Replacement Bands \u2713 \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\n6 Pro Replacement Bands \t\u2713 \t\u2713 \t\n60 lbs Chest Strap \t\t\u2713",

            "2 in 1 Upper Body Training Machine: Perform back extensions and abdominal crunches from the same seated position. The rotary flywheel mechanism allows for complete control over your starting position. Replaced the installation of the limiters, a simple plug can be completed between the back extension and AB crunch mode conversion. Designed to save space and money by combining two commonly separate machines, into one compact, multi-function machine.",
            "Perfect Bottom Support: This AB back machine has 8 adjustable positions of foot restraints. Adjustable distance range: 31.4\u2018\u2019- 36.3\u2018\u2019. You can choose the right length for your training. Foot restraints help anchor the user into place for better isolation and contraction of the posterior and anterior cores. The weight selector pin and stack are conveniently located for quick weight changes. Users can focus more selectively on target muscles, building core abdominal strength and back muscles",
            "Adequate Back Support: The 2 inch padded cushion is made with a high quality leatherette surface that is easy to clean while guaranteeing comfort during your workout. The seat height also has five adjustable options, with an adjustable height range of 20.8''-24.7'', so don't worry about height being a limitation to your use of this upper body training equipment.",
            "Full Range Adjustable: Rotary flywheel mechanism and pop pin design allow for easy adjustment. 27 selectable holes that enable you to achieve over 180 degrees of adjustment. It allows for complete control over your starting position.",
            "Sculpt Core Muscles: The core acts as the center of your body and helps you utilize every other part of your body to maximum efficiency. Building strong abs can mean reduced back pain, higher quality posture, functional strength, increase in sports performance and better all-around balance. Ab machines can help fill the gap between bodyweight core training and a core hardened by progressive overload."

Safer, easier to learn and lower impact on your joints to keep your health. \nReason1:Why \"LP05 Leg press machine\" not \"Press and Hack squat combo machine\"? \n\"Gains will lose\". Most leg combo machines in order to combine the functions and use a small footboard (only for narrow leg press). LP05 equips a 19*22'' big footboard and you can do all leg core muscle exercise on it. \nReason2:Why \"LP05 Leg press machine\" not \"Press and Hack squat combo machine\"? \nLet's do the math. LP05 equips 4x 10'' long weight pins for loading. Other combo machine only equips 2 weight pins. For leg training, you can have more weight options. \nReason3:Why \"LP05 Leg press machine\" not \"Press and Hack squat combo machine\"? \nThe aim muscles of the leg press and hack squat are similar. If you get combo machine, you are spending more budget and get repeated function. Why don't you buy a large footboard and heavier weight rating machine for your leg day and save your money? \nPrevious page\nNext page\n1 HEIGHT CHOICE 2 ADJUSTABLE BOARD 3 SAFETY LIMITER 4 ADJUSTABLE BAND PEG 5 FIT ALL WEIGHTS \nPrevious page\nNext page",
