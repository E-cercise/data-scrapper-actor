            "[Sculpt Your Upper Body] Ditch ordinary lat pull-downs for the innovative Scissor Lat pull-down! When users train on this scissor-style lat pulldown machine, they don't just pull the handles from high to low like they would with traditional lat pulldown machines. Instead, they can also pull them from wide to narrow \u2013 a feature that traditional lat pulldown machines simply don't have. Its entire movement path follows the direction of the back's muscle fibers more naturally",
            "[Dynamic Scissor Motion] Experience a unique workout sensation with the scissor motion design, which offers a smooth and natural range of motion. This innovative movement pattern maximizes muscle activation, the more natural movement path reduces the rotational stress on the shoulder joints and pressure on the elbow joints during normal pulldown motions",
            "[Isolateral Exercise] The independent arm design allows for isolated stimulation of the back muscles on each side, reducing the compensation that can occur in the final stages of exhaustion when using a straight bar or V-shaped handle, where the stronger side often compensates for the weaker side, thereby minimizing the occurrence of uneven muscle tension across the back",
            "[Dual Grip Design] This Back machine has both wide and narrow grips. Users can choose based on their needs. The wide grip emphasizes outer/upper lats, engages posterior deltoids & biceps, suitable for those with good shoulder flexibility wanting to widen back. The narrow grip targets lower/mid-lats more, reduces shoulder joint outward pressure, ideal for those with shoulder discomfort or aiming to ease shoulder strain",
            "[Adjustable Design] The lat machine features a 5-position adjustable leg holder and a 11-position adjustable seat, making it more accommodating for users with different arm spans and leg lengths. The weight-loading system is also suitable for users of various training levels, especially beginners who may struggle with bodyweight pull-ups and have less strength",
            "[Cross-base design] Mikolo lat pulldown machine features a cross-base design with a measurement of 52.88\u201d Depth x 42.11\u201d Width x 77.84\u201d Height and a total footprint of 15.46 square feet, this size is similar to a storage cabinet. Compared to typical structures, this design reduces the footprint while providing greater stability, allowing the machine's weight to be evenly distributed across the base, thereby preventing machine wobbling during use"

            "\u3010Transform Your Wall into a Gym\u3011With this versatile cable pulley system, you can do multiple fitness exercises at home. Whether you want to build strength, tone muscles, or improve endurance, this system has you covered.",
            "\u3010Innovative Pulley Design\u3011Unlike other products with only two pulleys on the rack, our cable pulley system gym has four pulleys on the rack and one on the loading pin, making it super smooth and very quiet. The pulleys on sides can keep the cable parallel on the wall, preventing the cable from interfering with the rise of the weight block.",
            "\u3010Multifunctional Fitness Equipment\u3011Our wall mounted cable machine can help you perform various exercises to train your upper body, lower body and core muscles. It comes with a tricep rope, a pull down rope and a straight bar, which can be used for different LAT cable attachments. It can also be used as a pull-up bar and a punching bag hanger.",
            "\u3010Super Stable and Durable\u3011The 12 hole design of our wall mounted pull up bar is more stable and safer than other products. It can support up to 400 lbs of weight and is made of high-quality iron material. It is easy to install and comes with all the mounting hardware you need.",
            "\u3010Satisfaction Guarantee\u3011We are confident that you will love our wall mounted cable pulley system gym, but if you are not satisfied for any reason, please feel free to contact our 24-hour customer service."
