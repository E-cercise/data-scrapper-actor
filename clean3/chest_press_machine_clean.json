        "description": "Product DescriptionPerform a variety of ab exercises easily, effectively, and safely with the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20). The adjustable, ergonomic AB crunch bench seat can be adjusted into 3 different positions to accommodate a wide range of heights and motion. The AB workout bench seat is angled at 45-degrees and reclines to 2 different 5-degree angles for a wide range of motion. This abdominal bench with adjustable length, textured grip handles, standard weight post, and 2-position footrests make it is comfortable and easy to perform exercises such as ab crunches and knee raises. When assembled the Body-Solid Best Fitness Semi Recumbent AB Bench (BFAB20) measures 64 by 11 by 46 inches (L x W x H). The frame is backed by the Best Fitness 3-year Warranty and the parts are backed by a 1 year warranty.Amazon.comMake any time crunch time with the Best Fitness BFAB20 semi-recumbent ab crunch. Unlike some other ab machines--which require the agility of an acrobat to be thoroughly effective--the BFAB20 puts you in a comfortable seated position without sacrificing your workout efficiency. The ergonomically designed machine is built to help you tighten up your midsection, strengthen your back, and improve your core stability, with your choice of toning your lower abs with knees raises or your upper abs with abdominal crunches. To perform ab crunches, simply use the upholstered upper back support, textured grip handles, and standard weight post. Performing knee raises is just as easy thanks to the adjustable-length, two-position footrests. Add in a three-position upholstered seat--which starts at 45 degrees but offers two additional 5-degree reclining positions--and you have everything you need to design an effective ab regimen in the comfort of your own home.  The BFAB20 is an essential workout accessory because your core is where all your body movements originate. Your abdominal muscles support and protect your internal organs and aid in breathing, especially when you exhale. The abs also team up with your back muscles to control trunk motions, such as twisting and bending. The BFAB20 takes the next step by also strengthening and toning the front of the thighs and increasing hip flexibility. The end results include a flatter stomach, better defined abs, well-developed obliques, a more upright posture, and greater support for your spine. Other features include a 1.75-inch upholstered seat, a durable powder-coated finish, and safety pins and bolts that allow for easy disassembly or permanent setup. The BFAB20 measures 22 by 46 by 64 inches (W x H x D) and carries a three-year warranty.",
