        "description": "Become the best version of yourself! Develop great upper body strength including; your core, chest, shoulders, arms, and back. With this easy to install door frame bar - you get it all. Perform a variety of exercises and different types of pull-ups with the comfort grips from nearly any interior doorway (ranging from 24\" - 32\" wide). There are several grip options - standard grip overhand pull-ups, wide-grip pull-ups, neutral-grip pull-ups, or opposite grip (one overhand - the other underhand) pull-ups, there are plenty of ways to challenge yourself and mix things up in your pull-up routine all while strengthening your back, shoulders and arms. The challenge continues when you take your workout bar to the floor. Not only do you have multiple options with pull-ups, you also have a wide array of choices to select when doing floor exercises as well. Try mixing up your hand positions when doing push-ups with wide, narrow, and neutral grips. Each of these will develop different areas of your chest, shoulders, and arms. Turn your body over and grab the curved handles to perform some dips and work on the triceps. You can also add to the intensity by putting some weight onto your lap...but wait, there's more! Put the bar back in the door frame at the floor level and use it as a holder for your feet to get some hardcore core and ab work done. Mix in different variations of ab exercises to really get that hard earned six pack you've been looking for. Put the bar back up in the top of the door frame to get some hanging leg raises in. Turn yourself into the man you know you can be with the help of the pull-up and push-up workout bar!",

Beginners can use the ground, a chair, or a stool to assist them as they build strength to complete their first pull-up. For those who are more advanced, mix up hand positions and try different grips to keep things interesting",
            "\u2605 GET RESULTS BY CHANGING THINGS UP: For best results, don't exercise the same muscle groups everyday - mix things up.

With the multiple grip options on the bar, there are plenty of variations to choose from so you can have a unique routine",

        "description": "The Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar is the only one that uses 1-1/4\" diameter steel tubing. This makes it the strongest one on the market. Don't be fooled by other I-Beam Pull Up Bars that claim to use 1-1/4\" steel tubing but ship 1.0\" steel tubing. We are proud to supply the United States Navy with our I-Beam Pull Up Bars (see product images). The United States Military has strict guidelines for strength and durability, which our product had no trouble meeting. The I-Beam Pull Up Bar is easy to install in 15 minutes or less, no drilling required. The unique design uses (6) bolts to clamp to the bottom flange of the I-Beam. Once installed it feels like the Pull Up Bar is welded to the I-Beam. It comes with foam rubber grips that give you 3 different pull up variations (wide, close, and pistol grip). These different variations isolate different muscles giving you a more complete workout. The Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar is engineered to last. It comes with a LIFETIME WARRANTY and is 100% made in the USA. If you have access to a steel I-beam you have to try the Firstlaw Fitness I-Beam Pull Up Bar. If you are not 100% satisfied with this product return it for a full refund, no questions asked. Please contact Firstlaw Fitness with any questions through Amazon or direct from our website.",

Testing shows the product can handle up to 744 lbs (337.5 kg) of instantaneous load, meeting a 2.5x safety factor. However, the pull up bar's capacity also depends on the usage environment. Users should strictly adhere to the 135 kg limit",

Ensure your doorway or wall is solid; avoid ceramic tiles, glass or non-solid doorframe. Note: Verify the marked rotation direction; reversing it may cause locking",
