        "features": [
            "[Independent Dual Pulley System] Unlike the common power cage, the HR05 has an independent 1:1 ratio double pulley system on both sides of the frame. 1:1 means that the weight you train is the weight you load. And the weight capacity of power rack will double. The independent pulley system allows you to complete super set, drop set, co-training and other gym workouts without being limited by the home gym weight stack cap.",
            "[4-IN-1 Home Gym Partner] HR05 combines a power rack, multi-grip pull up bar, cable crossover machine and 360\u00b0 landmine into one machine. At the same time, the pulley system has been upgraded to give you a seamless and stable movement experience. The improved sliding sleeve ensures smooth operation while protecting the pulley from damage. Gross Weight: 205 lbs. The machine boasts a maximum capacity of up to 2000 lbs.",
            "[Unique Column] More holes have been drilled into the HR05 power cage's posts at 1-inch spacing, giving you a total of 30 height options. There are also digital markers on the side to help you locate quickly. In addition, we use the standard 2\"x 2\" column, which can be adapted to a variety of accessories on the market to unlock more training possibilities. The tube thickness of 2 mm effectively ensures the stability of the power rack.",
            "[Space-saving Design] Another major feature of the HR05 is the space savings, the frame design is closer to half rack, compared to most power racks, its space can be reduced by nearly two-thirds. In addition, we are equipped with more weight storage areas in the middle of HR05, which can not only effectively organize the space of the home gym, but also increase the stability of the shelves.",
            "[Fully equipped & versatile] The HR05 power cage comes with all the attachments you may need more of in your daily training. including 4 free handle attachments, 2 safety spotter pins, dip bars, j hooks, and T-bar row attachment. This provides a wide range of exercises, such as wide & narrow lat pull-downs, T-bar rows, seated cable rows, bench presses, squats, deadlifts, bicep curls, triceps extensions, pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, and more."

            "[Compact for Limited Space] The LP10 leg press and hack squat machine, with dimensions of 67 inches (L) x 52 inches (W) x 47 inches (H) and a footprint of only 24.2 sq. m., offers efficient space utilization. Compared to other large combo machines, this machine can save almost 1/3 of the space. The installation manual and video guide you through the assembly quickly. The LP10 is ideal for limited spaces such as a garage or home gym.",
            "[Unique 30\u00b0Combo Machine] Unlike the common 45\u00b0leg press hack squat combo machine on the market, we offer a unique 30\u00b0positive angle. The relaxed 30\u00b0position enables better isolation of the quadriceps, and it\u2019s friendly for individuals with insufficient lower back strength and knee joint issues. Compared to traditional squat racks and barbells, it\u2019s generally considered safer and more user-friendly.",
            "[Pocket-Friendly] Save your wallet without compromising the effectiveness of your leg workout.",
            "[Full Range of Motion] Another great feature of the LP10 leg press hack squat combo machine is its full range of motion, which allows you to achieve deeper depth in your squats, even allowing for an ATG squat. Most 45\u00b0combo machines have a seat pad installed under the guide rail for users to get support while doing leg press, but this overall squat range is limited. In comparison, the LP10 is definitely a wise choice.",
            "[Easy Adjustable, Easy Organize] The backboard and foot pedals can be adjusted in 7 angles respectively to target different muscle groups. The shoulder pad used for assisting hack squats is removable and has 3 adjustable positions to accommodate people of different heights. We also added a storage area at the back of the product to keep your weight plates organized. The band pegs allow you to use resistance bands for resistance training.",
            "[Stable Construction] The LP10 has excellent stability and smooth performance. The steel tubes of the rails are 3mm thick and very robust. With a maximum weight capacity of 1000 lbs, it's solid and reliable. Our unique stop-loss device, featuring 1 solid stopper and 5 adjustable hole positions, ensures 100% injury prevention. Each stopper can handle a weight of up to 500 lbs."
