            "[Customized Your Workout Plan] The monitor on our indoor cycling bike can capture your time, spd, dst, cal, odometer, and keep track of your exercise progress in real time. A dial tension knob to navigate the unlimited resistance levels makes you experience riding from the flat to the mountains. With a tablet holder you can watch spin class on your Tablet while riding to simulate traveling through France, gravel rides through the Utah backcountry, and even mountain bike rides in New Zealand.",

Extended reach from saddle to handlebar enables space for all sizes of riders. The featured transport wheels allow you to move your stationary bike from indoor to outdoor.

Well, we've got you covered, friend. The WIRK Ride Workstation lets you pedal your way to better health while keeping your productivity high. You can also push the desktop to the forward to convert to a standing desk.A Place to WorkThe work surface (17.25\"W x 10\"D) provides a great place to set your laptop or super-secret documents. Or, if tablets are your thing, simply prop it up on the handy-dandy adjustable tablet holder to the angle that works for you. The molded cup holder keeps your drink nice and safe from your occasional clumsiness (or is that just us at Stamina?). The desktop also includes molded handles and a fitness monitor that tracks time, speed, distance, calories, total distance. It even has a scan function so that you don't have to fixate yourself on one stat.A Place to RideThe WIRK Ride has its name for a reason. The adjustable magnetic tension exercise bike makes it easy to work your leg muscles and elevate your heart rate. It has a super comfy padded seat and backrest because we actually want you to use it! The seat height is adjustable to fit your ideal pedaling position.Standing RoomIt turns out that sitting all day isn't good for you. Even if you are pedaling! So, we've come up with a way to let you use the Ride as a Stand-Up workstation as well. The desktop easily pushes away from the seat by pushing up on the release with your foot and gently pushing away. Then, stand up and get your WIRK on!",

It's built to handle up to 2000 watts of power and can automatically adjust resistance based on the slope, mimicking slopes of up to 15% during challenging climbs.",
            "Work with Most Bike Models: The Sportneer Smart Bike Trainer is a perfect match for both road and mountain bikes, supporting wheel sizes of 26\", 28\", 29\", or 700c. It accommodates rear axle widths ranging from 3' to 6.37'. It's important to note that the trainer includes a quick release skewer, so if you have a thru-axle bike, you'll need to purchase an adapter separately.",
            "Quiet & Stable : The U-shaped structure, wide frame, anti-slip rubber feet, and dual locking knobs on the rear axle ensure unwavering stability. This smart bike trainer also features a sleek aluminum flywheel that keeps noise levels below 68 decibels, even at speeds up to 30 km/h.",
            "Note: Noise levels may vary depending on the type of bike tire tread - the more aggressive the tread, the louder the noise. Therefore, it's recommended for road bikes, and if you have a mountain bike with rough tires, please purchase with caution."
